a completely obvious one 
thank fuck for tyrone mings 
just look at that from weghorst man how do you make tyrone mings look like a hero 
i think we’re relying on brentford now sad but true 
burnley winning too ashley barnes who elbowed tyrone mings in the face and var decided that's fine scores if someone made everton into a film i'd say it's too unrealistic 
i trust him 
utv vtid always loved tyrone mings me can’t believe those hurtful songs they sang 3 fookin points tonight ffs lads
