is there any sadio mane update 
🎙 sadio mané seemed to announce his departure from liverpool i would like to thank the fans for everything and the coach too i wish this team all the best in the world source tired of salah's lack of team work 
yeah he's far better at least in leaking every liverpool player is overrated except sadio mane there was a combined xi drawn by a shiity journalist hours before the final in paris that has only modric and benzema from madrid while the remaining nine are liverpool 
bro thought abt revenge against his team mate sadio mane but lost too 
🚨 sadio mané announced his departure from liverpool to his teammates after the game 😢🇸🇳 source plettigoal 
sadio mane is hungry 
also sadio mane one 
veekesh yeah maybe salah shouldn't be so selfish and give pens to mane maybe then sadio wouldn't want to leave son is more impressive pens are easy for pros 
vinicius jnr should be part of the top 6 contender for the ballon d'or 3 trophies this season and has many goals assist than sadio mane mane is just an overhyped fraud 🤝 
diogo jota is weak salah too slow and liverpool decided to sell sadio mané instead what a joke 
there are too many fake news about sadio mane and the liars are using your name 
sadio mane news please my brother 🥺 
bayern are discussing a three year deal with sadio mane's representatives 
give it a rest for a couple of days man when sadio is ready to say it you'll find out your like a blood thirsty person man seriously your probly not out of bed long and the first thing you think about is how can i annoy liverpool fans more than they are oh wait talk about mane 
what about sadio mane after the cl final 
beardo what happened 4 years back doesn't matter 4 years back glenn murray scored more prem goals than sadio mane 
timmzy oy neymar has been racially abused before neymar is considered black oga stop defending your nonsense you must not be dark as sadio mane to be black 
what about sadio mane 
lets talk about sadio mane please 
sad day when united's chelsea's and arsenal's only success is liverpool only domestic the double i'm more sad about sadio mane 😢 
mane won the golden boot with salah when liverpool won the league crucial goals in all 3 of our ucl final runs literally dragged us to the finish this season when salah went to shit whenever it's counted sadio has always stepped up i hope he's more appreciated at his next club 
😭😭😭😭made sadio mane change teams 
any news about sadio mane 
if madrid need an attacker i'm all for sadio mane class baller 
and if the rumours about sadio mané leaving are true it'll be a sad day but i've got nothing but good memories the way he played for the last few months was amazing what a guy 👊🏽 
as english as sadio mane 
sadio mane wants to leave for bayern munich i think he'll leave immediately 
him and sadio mane 
where is sadio mane playing next season my friend staying or leaving 
he is nothing without sadio mane 
ps79 i think this is part of the thing with me sadio mane is synonymous with the jurgen klopp era and the exciting attacking teams should he leave which seems likely if rumours are to be believed then it feels like the begining of the end in a strange way 
i don't know because sadio mané's interview after the final seems that he will leave the club this summer but nothing official yet 
liverpool keep salah salah is good player his better than mané and let sadio go stay with the people who will love him appreciate him and not you hypocrites everything sadio has done to you this season what did you give him as a gift 
true and we all know how much the assembly in northern ireland not sitting has affected sadio mane amp virgil these past few months heartbreaking 
tarunx luis diaz in carvajal's pocket all game trent getting dusted by vini everytime he made a run sadio mane going mia but the only player creating chances and charging at the gk was the worst player on the pitch 
goodbye sadio mane good luck at new club thanks for memories liverpool bayern ucl ynwa 
why exactly do people deep that sadio mane deserves the ballon d'or i honestly do not get it afcon and sending his team to the world cup mbappe won nations league and sent his team to the world cup too no 🤡 
goodbye sadio mane good luck in bayern thanks for memories liverpool bayern ucl ynwa 
congratulations to all contenders especially mohammed salah mo deserves it more than sadio mane in my opinion due to his scoring and assists records however karim benzema overall should be awarded ballon d'or for sure he's a leader of all uclfinal bbcfootball livrma

sadio mané we didn't take our chances and it costed us the fans didn't stop singing i want to thank them for everything and the boss but i think it's a goodbye lfc 
sadio mane deserves this 
with bobby and taki coming in from the bench it's likely that sadio mane will be a good enough replacement in the front three 
he has and had it not been for that reason i would have preferred they give it to sadio mane 
s i sincerely hope its sadio mane noone is more deserving but again he is african 
homebayern this is the fake news plettenberg has deleted this tweet after sadio mané's demanding please check it again

kiunga that's right with sadio mane going to bayern 
m is sadio mane staying if not where is he going to 
official21 how can you possibly hate sadio mane such a generous and humble person even rival fans love him over salah or any other liverpool player he's class 
irb ll liverpool board is such a selfish ungrateful bunch of lots the fact that with all that sadio mane performance they've never bothered to open up talks to improve his contract says it all his next deal should be all about money for him whether at liverpool or elsewhere 
sadio mane has had a worldie of a season mate afcon and 2 domestics but benzema has carried his team to the ucl and league with 55 g a in all comps it's not even a debate fella 
nah fam sadio mane had an incredible season because he is black they won't acknowledge it 
lilag1 this tweet blew up cause of sadio mane

steve morrow better than sadio mane😉 
tz66 nechi liverpool sadio mane 
srk 07 never performs in big stages liverpool fans hype him as if he's ronaldo level sadio mane is better than him 
a message to liverpool fc players like sadio mané and mohamed salah like they always say if you can't beat them join them real madrid 
lol word on the street is mo salah and sadio mane leaving liverpool 
13 diaz dembele salah jota firmino minamino has sadio mane actually come out and said he is leaving yet a while ago i was hoping mane stays and ousmane dembele replaces takumi minamino in our squad depth i think some fans want a more number nine type of centre forward now though 
345 yeah i agree we will get a lift after the parade too and be focused on strengthening our squad and maybe hearing sadio mané might be staying perhaps roll on next season 
and now i think i'll support senegal as well sadio mane sadio mane don't go please stay at lfc 😭 
liverpool have play three final in this season and their attacker never score the goal so why liverpool team want to contract with sadio firmino and mane with again poor attacker ever after 2017 and then liverpool want cheaper attacker again again again shame on you

i'll leave y'all with some words from the poet sadio mane mane sadio i took a loss today but i still wake up tomorrow 
lilag1 ok who else thought she was referring to sadio mane 
any sadio mane news lad 
sadio mane mo salah first two i thought of 
but sadio mane is leaving am happy mo salah is sad cause what he did as muslim person 
harrington any sadio mane news will he leave 
given that they have the attacking quality of mohamed salah sadio mane luis diaz roberto firmino and diogo jota it is always a surprise when they do not hit the back of the net it did not cost them in the efl cup and fa cup but it did here 
needs to be said that when it matters most salah again wasn't there if he wants to be revered amp receive the big money he needs to show up and he didn't indeed once again it was sadio mane mane always stands up in the big games he was our best by some margin today 
please wait about sadio mane 👀 anoy latest update will he make a move to another club or eventually sign a new contract with lfc 
didn't sound too good after the game sadio mané i think it's a tricky one the game tonight we are disappointed the fans have been amazing i want to thank them for everything and the boss i wish this team all the success in the world lfc 
xa03 sadio mané is the best football player in the world 
what about sadio mane 
luis diaz can succeed sadio mané the position in the front that needs to be added to liverpool is cf 
everytime i see the words sadio mane all i think about is the scouse kid saying he's the best player in the wourld 
can't salah pass this ball to sadio mané so we score that guy is too selfish and he's the cause we lost the champions league benzema would have pass that ball to junior without thinking twice because at this stage it's about the club not individual achievement salah is wicked 
your tweet was quoted in an article by sporting news 
age liverpool fans chose salah over him in afcon finals and world cup qualifiers forget salah's tap in and mallam goals sadio mane was the real deal and enforcer in the liverpool team
