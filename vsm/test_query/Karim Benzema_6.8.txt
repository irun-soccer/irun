did you actually say karim benzema finally gets on harry kane level 🤣🤣 i can't believe you said something along those lines 
quel serait votre top 10 pour le ballondor 🥇 karim benzema 🥈 thibaut courtois 🥉 kevin de bruyne 4⃣ vinicius jr 5⃣ kylian mbappé 6⃣ r lewandowski 7⃣ luka modric 8⃣ sadio mané 9⃣ christopher nkunku 🔟 mo salah 
karim benzema should be the clear favourite 
u are entitled to your opinion bt i disagree with u on this vinicius jr is very vital to real madrid's success this season bt i will give it to karim benzema for his exploits he has been scoring goals since d onset of the season amp also replicate such as d ucl 
crypt0 may your trading journey be full of karim benzema energy bg 
so all this lucky thing started since the 1st leg vs psg real madrid had to play injured karim benzema and ferland mendy in the game cortouis had stop 9 shots on target and saved his 3rd consecutive pen well if ddg ter stegen does that they're best itw well played psg tho 
i think it's and not karim benzema 
stup up you fraud 🤡 nothing against vini one of the best but karim benzema is best player in the world 
it's a shame not to include karim benzema with him he helped him a lot 
great season for the great karim💪🏽 
aa7on aa7on hi aaron all of our player statistic markets are determined by opta provided data and they have declared karim benzema did not have a shot on target in the match 
ballon d'or karim 'the dream' benzema signed and sealed 
congratulations on your success karim benzema i like your style of playing football i hope you win the ballon d'or this year 🎉🎉 
prof1 probably vini is too much but he's done an amazing season and courtois he's been as important as karim in laliga and ucl
