my pick for the second best player this season is thibaut courtois his crucial saves are really important his penalty save against messi perhaps is the highlight of his season he won us 3 points so many times we are lucky to have the best players at both ends of the field 
benzema obviously has one of the most important positions on the field tonight he needs to be at the top of his game as he always is he needs to absolutely obliterate the defense to slot it in he does and he will courtois if we want to win tonight thibaut needs to thrive 
odds on thibaut courtois to be carded 
odds on thibaut courtois to be carded can't seem to find it 
the way media has made it that allison is better keeper because courtois has conceded a lot of goals will make you think that liverpool didn't concede a goal when thibaut only conceded 1 more than allison also he doesn't face many shots but still concedes as many as thibaut 
bro for tonight its going to be ▪️liverpool vs real madrid ▪️jurgen klopp vs carlo ancelotti ▪️alisson becker vs thibaut courtois ▪️sadio mane vs vinicius junior ▪️mohamed salah vs karim benzema and my support is drifting for 👏🏆

liverpool either must have great luck in front of goal which is improbable due to thibaut courtois or they must keep the ball 
only 1 reason i'm supporting liverpool thibaut courtois 
nübel on his ideal gk🎙 for kicking i think the best is marc andré ter stegen for the reading of the game manuel neuer is obviously the strongest coming off his line as he does there is also thibaut courtois who is very good in front of his goal

this real madrid are good by scoring goals their defense is horrible maybe thibaut courtois to step up with more reflexes and saves liverpool can defend their goals when they score 
of chelsea it's because of eden hazard and the cash benefit from real madrid to chelsea should they win champions league trophy while hazard is their player if it's for thibaut courtois i say liverpool should trash them
