olashubomii alaba the reason alaba celebrated with a chair seems pretty obvious real madrid is the king of europe as the 14 time winner of the champions league they sit on the throne

alaba number one defender 
alaba cry harder 🤣 nobody ask 
fellas it's simple alaba didn't have his hands behind his back mind the new fifa rule that a penalty could be given if the ball hit the arm hand when it's on an extended position for me i think liverpool was only dominated by their very own mindset of revenge kudos 
alaba please do a iconic statue at outside stadium 😅😅😅😅 
alaba hello 
alaba es alabooooommmm

alaba never could i have imagined that someone can replace ramos as good as alaba did 🪑 
alaba we all know you hand balled that 
alaba wheres salah's revenge blud 
alaba man speaking german 😂😂😂😂 
alaba up spain 
alaba undeserved 
alaba my two favorite players of your club 
alaba small club and small players 🤣 
alaba so undeserved 
alaba who and who 
alaba best career decision 
alaba how is your horse 🐴😂 
don mmrocky bradlee basant2 alaba sad tweet 
alaba david alaba brought out the chair again 😂 
alaba you have to bring the chair to cibeles 🤣🤣🤣 
alaba i love this comrade 
alaba thanks muller 
alaba he meant the chair is a champions league seat and madrid is the rightful owner so when we're up no one sits on it even if you sit madrid will definitely come for it 
dreaper alaba henoc baka from can defend that 😎🤏 
alaba congrats real madrid 
david alaba real doing great business 
alaba just one season two trophies already welcome to right place 
can't believe you let go alaba 
mmrocky bradlee basant2 alaba that wouldn't matter to alaba he has to celebrate the fans 
alaba couldn't even clean alaba's shoes 
mdna alaba yeah villarreal has owe and a sheik too the 7th of la liga kick you out wake up man 🤣🤣🤣 
alaba whomas 
juancarloleon dreaper alaba i will take such mistake from anyone but not defenders man was busy with offensive football and he forgot what defenders does when in 18 yard box 
dreaper alaba if you're not a defender then you won't understand valverde who passed the ball was far wide he didn't expect vinicus who was so far away to be the receiver 
alaba only bayerns can set the madrid fire 🔥 off 
alaba class 
rabada looks like david alaba 
mmrocky bradlee basant2 alaba god bless you bro nice schooling from you 
alaba badxt guy😂 
alaba chairman where's the chair 
alaba i pray he's able to play in his actual position next season he's really done well playing in the central defense but he'd be more useful playing on the left wing dishing out all the assists 
alaba i love you 
alaba and barcelolna is busy congratulating us on their official page 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 
alaba militao was holding on to it for life 
alaba try fifa 22🤣🤣🤣 
milii alaba leave this nonsense for barca fans 
alaba as usual 😂😂😂🙌🏿 
mmrocky bradlee basant2 alaba the emptiest tin makes the loudest noise 
alaba great 
alaba champion 
alaba nothing really it was an unplanned celebration that went viral and he continued the beautiful celebration 
mmrocky basant2 alaba i get it now thanks 
milii alaba cry well this shows how score to settle can not carry liverpool perfect team 
alaba is a chairman lol 
alaba they should drop by at mbappe's and hand it over to him he'll be needing it 
alaba i totally agree with you 
mmrocky bradlee basant2 alaba just going to be honest here objectively speaking liverpool fans were significantly louder than the madrid fans don't really understand how you can flaunt your supporter presence when you were outplayed both on and off the pitch 
alaba he was the main man last night he had every chance to score more than 2 goals he made the quick change for the team and fans we love him and i believe he wants to win more trophies with the club 
cultured alaba he is warning sule not alaba 
forever alaba what's does d chair mean 
bradlee mmrocky basant2 alaba he raised a chair while celebrating either the equalizer or the winner against psg it became an iconic moment 
alaba what's the story behind it 
suristic the only trophy remaining for alaba and in madrid now is copa dey rey and the just arrived this season 🏆💥💥💥💥🏆💥🏆💥 
alaba i give credit of your performances last night 
alaba wow congratulations 
alaba thank youuu legend ❤

uefa must ask toni kroos luka modric david alaba and karim benzema to retire they are making the best footballing teams look mediocre psg chelsea city liverpool 🙄🙄🙄🙄 
mmrocky bradlee basant2 alaba normally you be thug ba😀😀😀😀 
alaba you're pushing official out he is the the only star at fcb you need at least 6 stars and few regular players official needs other stars so he can get free in big games you loose without him or if they cover him scores goals in small clubs only 
alaba u must learn from them what happen when u sell quality players they win uclfinal with other clubs instead you buy random players pls learn from they win even when they're bad with these quality players 
alaba madrid for real 
shouldn't it be the other way around alaba lol vamos campeones 🪑 
dreaper alaba we shouldn't be having this conversation if the defender tried to defend defenders always look around to see if anyone was behind them in the box trent never looked back from the onset he would have stopped vini if he tried to defend 
dreaper alaba he was horrible he never looked around and he's a defender 
joe03 o 96 player like sergio busquet joshua kimchi david alaba philip lamh fernandinho play different wings on the field of play and they play it right a coach that see potential of a player that even the player can not see respect to pep🙌

mmrocky basant2 alaba screenshoter all 'light' 
earl3 emelie1 alaba the chair actually is dedicated to the real madrid fans in his alaba post game interview after psg second leg at the bernabeau he said the fans never gave up and kept supporting the team even when they are loosing so he called the fans the 12th player the team has copied 
man of the match it was david alaba the way he was celebrating each save that courtois made it beautiful to watch 
alaba nigeria blood 
alaba the world needs a bayern madrid final do your best to get there 
alaba congratulations baba 
bradlee basant2 alaba the connection is that the fan sat down on their seat all through the trying period without giving up hence the reason why the most easy way to recognize what they did was to raise a seat in the air pointing it to them denoting that this win won't be possible without you all 
alaba not an orange chair though 
alaba imagine after ferguson 2013 liverpol 2 trophy more then united 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 
alaba you are welcome at to finish your amazing career with a couple of more

bradlee mmrocky basant2 alaba fans glued their asses to their seats even though real madrid were losing so maybe that's the significance of the chair
