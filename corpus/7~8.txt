We have the money.@AVFCFaithful_ My favourite bit was when he tried to charge down a Douglas Luiz pass.@WayneMull82 It's not a great from Luiz on the 2nd, but he isn't a 6 and Carney put him under loads of pressure with his pass. Also no reason for Mane to be that alone in the box. Douglas not great there, but certainly not alone.@PreeceObserver Douglas Luiz has catastrophic mistakes in every game and his latest one lead to the Liverpool second goal.@AVFCOfficial The moment things went downhill, We had Iroegbunam sitting on the bench, A like for like replacement…Douglas Luiz is not a DM, he was playing quite well in a more advanced role up until that point 😶 https://t.co/GkZVTd4yhv@TheLawless bro it doesn't matter whos in his squad 😂 villa are shite. we aren't. we create better chances, we score more goals. and we don't have coutinho or Douglas Luiz. villa are trash. and they were even worse under Smith who was there for most the season.1️⃣0️⃣1️⃣

#AVLLIV | #EPL https://t.co/91wVV5iMZd@GoonScruffy He's playing with Douglas Luiz and Coutinho lets not act like he plays for Burnley. He's also been playing in a strike partnership with Ings same as Haller did. Didn't he also play up front with Toney?@1878_L_EFC Douglas luiz@SeanDOlfc Douglas luiz tooDouglas Luiz has only been moved back to a No. 6 for 10 minutes or so and he looks like such a poor player. Bizarre sub.@DOL17 Matty Cash, Douglas Luiz, McGinn@VillaViews_ That goal was an advert for why Douglas luiz is not a defensive mid@thecardstipster Thiago and Douglas Luiz@BigPuss24 Douglas Luiz gave the ball away then didnt track back. He should have the assist@StanCollymore Douglas Luiz role in that 
Gifted possession.
Never got back.
That's why hes not good enough for top 10@premierleague Douglas luiz scores!!

Liverpool players are commiting so many fouls and not even one yellow card has been distributed. Fabinho committed about 4/5 fouls and no yellow card. Douglas Luiz has been kicked so many times. Even free kicks which should have gone to Villa he gave it Liverpool@ValueBetSpotter Douglas Luiz 3 mins I win 🥳🥳@half_turn Tielemans or Douglas Luiz for Arsenal Lcm?@Hastful And the Douglas Luiz one? Not saying our goal should is stood but that’s var’s job to over turn. But that was the worst 45 mins of reffing I’ve ever seen@TacticallyMatt Douglas Luiz does the same?

With his hands. Yellow card@hastingos Going from mctominay to Douglas luiz is like going out with a 1/10 and then dumping her to go with a 3/10@FinallyVVD Maybe, that Douglas Luiz handball decision was horrendous as well. I think it might be a case of referee trying to favour away team a bit in order to not fall into the “home pressure” narrative and going a bit overboard@Uzibemybaeyaaaa Douglas Luiz was on onside, what are you talking about??? Are we watching the same game?@_dheo__ Douglas Luiz@CityXtraPod A Liverpool player found Douglas luiz earlier in the game and Liverpool get the free kick 🦵@MonkeyHal You mean Douglas luiz's assistant referee?@ballsdotie Douglas Luiz and John McGinn would like words...or would they?

https://t.co/fKRnvWjgb2@BBCSport The officiating in this match is fucking woeful.

The standard MUST improve asap, it’s beyond a joke.Jonathan Moss won’t be satisfied until Liverpool breaks Douglas Luiz’s leg.@AnfieldWatch But when Douglas luiz scores and watkins is offside it’s fine@StevenMcinerney what do you reckon to Douglas Luiz coming back to city as the Fernandinho replacement ?

#avfc | #utv | #vtidLiverpool travel to Aston Villa

First, let's take a look at the expected starting lineups for both teams.

Aston Villa
Expected lineup: (4-3-1-2): Martínez; Konsa, Mings, Digne; McGinn, Chambers, Douglas Luiz; Ings, Watkins.

Missing Players: Jacob Ramsey, Kortney Hause, Leon@danielhavfc @Gazoaks Yeah, I quite agree mate. He'd be foolish to rest his best player Douglas Luiz.This season across the Eredvisie, Europa league and Conference league Sangare has an average match rating of 7.19 in comparison to Douglas Luiz’s 6.89. This shows (by sofascore metrics) that Sangare outperforms Douglas Luiz statistically on a game by game basis. #avfc https://t.co/q348w7U2RD@WilliamHill Douglas luiz and digne both to be booked #YourOdds@Just_kmin He is going to win accidentally.. our boy Douglas Luiz going to score.😂 https://t.co/irOjkmpHM3@alexw_roberts @livingstones4 @TomYoungSJ Would respect this list if you hadn't mentioned Angelino, Douglas Luiz, Pedro porro, torres, Delph and Roberts and otamendi the first 4 were sold for a fairly big profit. Delph was instrumental to atleast one title. Roberts was like 2 or 3 mil@alexw_roberts @livingstones4 @TomYoungSJ You have to take a few out. Profit was made on Angelino, Porro, Douglas Luiz, Torres. Delph is shit but played a vital part in the centurion season. Can't blame the club for Mendys stuff. Grealish too early to call a failure.@Son_Lyme Play both. It's possible if we revert to the 4-3-3 narrow attack that Gerrard favours with both just in behind Watkins or Ings. 

Proper DM and then McGinn &amp; JJ or Douglas Luiz in front.
