They’re the ones chasing, so the lack of creativity in midfield isn’t such an issue for Arsenal, especially if they press effectively. Ben Davies being suspended would suggest Romero moves to LCB to lock down the side that Saka might start on.@fvckazzar Bit mad to be talking about trophies when your guy should be focusing on being able to beat players like Sessegnon and Ben Davies 1v1 first@thespursweb We might want more players but don't look at Ben Davies.

Wouldn’t piss on Richarlison if he was on fire either@EvertonBlueArmy @richarlison97 @anthonygordon @BenG0dfrey Is that a picture of Anthony Gordon being told about it?@CitySection Fair enough on the Jota penalty, it was very soft as was the Anthony Gordon penalty that you're complaining about@DanEmslie02 Anthony Gordon@unorthodoxcam_ Yeah I don’t want him at all, poor attitude as well, rather we signed Anthony Gordon@toffee_tower @james_hainie @henrywinter Well I look forward to Anthony Gordon been red carded soon for cheating.@EFCJosh7 @MPLS_Cheesehead @Joel_1878 @MNUFC @Everton Imagine being from a country were you know Josh Sargent but not Anthony Gordon 🤮🤮🤮.@MPLS_Cheesehead @Joel_1878 @MNUFC @Everton Okay and??? U should know who Anthony Gordon is since he scored past you a few week ago fella.@FearAtmos Naw. Mitchell and Murray play the same way! The only difference is Murray puts in effort defensively. It should have been Murray, Bones, DeRozan, Gordon, Jokić. And here’s why. Murray moves to shooting guard and DeRozan is a solid defender. Bones is going to grow into that PG and@Munacorleone kdbuttocks without space is not better than abdoulaye doucoure@PED7 Anthony Gordon and Demarai Gray looked liked they had walked from Merseyside to Watford, they were both walking all game in comparison to Iwobi who ran his bollocks off@Evertonian1992 Bit more bravery or any bit of fucking bravery for that matter and we beat them tonight. So frustrating. Some of the decision making from Demarai Gray &amp; Anthony Gordon absolutely done my head in. Not good.@TacticallyMatt Two Words
Demarai Gray, that is how we didn’t win that@paulcaff Demarai Gray drives have put us in great positions but the end product for months has been terrible. 

The difference between the top talent and flash in the pan talents....@PED7 Demarai Gray was really poor…@RBMersey I'd get Demarai Gray on@seanrostron Oh-ho Demarai Gray
You should not have played the ball that way...@Adam_Jones94 If Demarai Gray looses the ball, he has to win it back and does not!! WTF, we need passion, we have none right now… too lethargic and slow!@AntohLibra_ @Itiswinny I hope Leeds keep sliding cause I still wanna see Demarai Gray  play in the premier League@arrywinks villa have gone from 11th to 11th
had sold grealish and brought in.... Ashley Young and Buendia

Everton who finished 10th now in a relegation battle and signed Begovic, Townsend, Demarai Gray who's best previous season was 4 goals, underperformed in Germany and had more@Leeds_Untied Very fair point.... But Liverpool paid £11.3 Konstantinos Tsimikas and we paid £13.50 for Firpo.

It's not about the level of investment, it's how poorly the money has been spent!@AnfieldEdition Keita 😂😂😂😂. Jones outperform naby lad everytime he plays. But jones won’t get a chance cuz he is not likable guy and doesn’t smile enough and doesn’t post enough on social media@SimboGuyborn Because we know Naby Keita is a baller@lfcryry I was watching a game that fab was miss kicking and gave the ball away 3 times allowing them to attack.   

I watched a game where naby was running around like a chicken offering very little giving the ball away ..
 If you think that keita was good god forbid@AyoJiggy_ That's to tell you there's nothing special Naby Keita does.@AnfieldEdition Naby Keita for me was just too incredible today a marvel to watch and also van dijk and Mane 3 great performers today@GrizzKhan @AC_1178 Grizz that naby keita is terrible lad@RicardoMohapatr @Arthur__Szn @TheAnfieldTalk I want everyone to shine so we can play a better football.. but this inconsistency is what naby abt.. btw, Yes: Curtis was better and u can spot the difference between Thiago n Keita.. no matter how bad it is; you trust that Thiago will come up with a good idea… Naby will not@AyoJiggy_ Haaa this is another Keita oo, no be Naby Keita you just described biko!!!

Man a fit Chamberlain will do all those under Klopp and still get more goals than the guy!!!@MagsOnSport @matthewj_99 @SamueILFC I mean, I’m not that weird to check your tweets but there’s this big myth about Naby Keita that the Twitter Liverpool fans create about him being good. The man’s a fraud and doesn’t belong in this team.@TheRedmenTV some thoughts:
1. We might be able to sell off Naby Keita in the summer...provided we only ask for one bag of Skittles
2. Jota was invisible
3. Diaz is a gem
4. Mane is on fire
5. Salah did not look like he could be bothered to come on
6. Jon Moss should be dropped to U-9 games@karlasciak @TheUnbearables2 @JamesPearceLFC This is the really odd thing. Keita is having his first decent sustained spell of form at the club and "fans" want to create a Hendo/Naby debate.

All the more odd because we have been lacking depth forever but these numpties can't see the benefit of supporting both!@FxFirmino @kilimanzarho @SeanDOlfc That was at half time u speng ahah. Anyway, another win for naby Keita@TheRedmenTV Anyone who thinks naby Keita is remotely decent needs their head shaking… he is absolutely shocking… does something decent every 5 games and everyone clings on to it to justify his price tag… he turns like a boat and looks like he’s treading water🤦🏻‍♂️@khykhelormur Naby Keita 27, dude looks 35💀😂@MagsOnSport @matthewj_99 @SamueILFC But under the same breath you’ll say Naby Keita is a world star. Joker@TweetChelseaUK Someone needs to do a check on the amount of times naby Keita deserves to be punched@lupinkz Think it’s Naby Keita@LFC #LFC #AVLLIV 
What is it with Klopp’s Keita fetish? Naby Lad should have been off earlier. WTF is he doing still not taken off? I just don’t get it?… I’m seriously.@AnfieldWatch Naby Keita is not good enough. Even Trent knows it, as he’s been annoyed linking up play with him.@SeanDOlfc Naby Keita dog shit?????Why have I never heard Naby Keita called a £100m flop? Swear it’s only ever Assna, Citeh and Mon Yew’s deals that get financially dissected like this@Kloppista_LFC @MoSalahFC_ @9squeeze Jones better player than keita. always outperform hendo and Keita but he not fan favorite or likeable lad like naby. Just need to smile more and post more on social media if he wants to gain support from fans@AyoJiggy_ You dy rate that Naby Keita?@SamueILFC And Naby Keita needs to be let go!!!@lfcalexx6 Jones the best player 1st half by a miles . always outperform hendo and Keita but he not fan favorite or likeable lad like naby. Just need to smile more if he wants to gain support from fans@bernardooooV3 Calling a Naby Keita screamer in the 77th minute@LFC Tell me if i'm wrong, what naby keita doing?@lfcaarxn Jones the best player 1st half by a miles but always outperform hendo and Keita but he not fan favorite or likeable lad like naby.@ant97j__ Nowhere near an exaggeration hahaha! Naby Keita isn't worth a Tommy tank;@Russ_Goldman If Liverpool change to a 4-2-3-1 formation for example You would have Fabinho and Thiago as the 2 in midfield with Naby Keita and Fabio Carvalho to battle for the number 10 role@iammcallum How Naby Keita plays for Liverpool I’ll never know.
Curtis isn’t that bad just goes missing in games@rob9massive Naby Keita starts the CL final@JamesPearceLFC Will this ‘real naby keita’ please stand up?@AnfieldWatch Naby keita shoulda scored that chance ;he’s still inconsistent come on Naby@laurenpat96 Naby Keita.  Good lord!!@SamueILFC Jones the best player 1st half by a miles but always outperform hendo and Keita but he not fan favorite or likeable lad like naby.@TheAnfieldTalk Naby Keita i woeful again. Sick to death of him now. Id have Milner in there over him an Jones any day of the week, shows ye how shite the pair of them crabs are@KhabyLame can tell Naby Keita how easy a tap in is. 🤷🏻‍♂️

#AVLLiv #PL@LFC Jones the best player 1st half by a miles but always outperform hendo and Keita but he not fan favorite or likeable lad like naby.@fin_gilmour Low-key agree. But can we all laugh at Naby Keita 😂@cleanbeanso Naby keita is the best footballer in the world rn. Respect@AnfieldWatch Are we done waiting for the "real naby keita" to show up yet?@GbaligonR @dannida2006 @freddysageworld @garyalsmith Ah buh who was VVD when he paid 75m for him ? 🤣🤣🤣
Notable for players at lower cost ??
Yy was Naby Keita ,Minamino not bought for cheap and made stars ??
Ur manager has spent over £600m and u think he doesn’t spend ??
😂😂😂😂…..den wat will Sean Dyche nd co also say@JamesPearceLFC Hopefully that’s not us seeing the real Naby Keita like he says@Shirey07 Naby keita just missed an open play@AnfieldWatch Awful they look like there already waiting to go on holiday, naby Keita shit Curtis jones shit costas shit fab beyond shit now injured even Allisson been awful@SlevinBessick Check here, why does Naby Keita look like Teko Modise man. Auj 🤣😭😂😅😭@IanDoyleSport Curtis Jones &amp; Naby Keita are so passive, Fabinho is struggling againI'm assuming if the answer is bad then twitter is saying its Naby Keita's fault?@TheKopHQ Still. To be fair curtis jones and naby keita offer nothing back the way keita jogs back.@__keepachris__ Naby keita in a difficult away game again@lfcmatt8 keita fc should be named naby noncesHad 1 more pre-match bet on the game ↓

◎ Naby Keita card - 7/2

📊 Had 3 cards in his last 7 games.

18+ | https://t.co/m4QCGwR2XS@TheonlyDG Naby Keita. You’re welcome.@FussballDan Great signing to be fair. Cheaper than naby keita too! 😂😂😂@ScouseSocialism @FrazerHennessey @trevor8sinclair They hasn’t signed naby keita…@ThaDragooner @sheila_gooner Man City’s depth is gundogun and Fernandinho and Liverpools in naby Keita and Milner. Madrid bring on camavinga. That’s the level of depth I want@Brandoncmoi @AllezLesLions @canal2inter Bro why are you moving like Choupo is a classic No.10 or a deep lying playmaker?! The guy is a target forward who can play deeper. Doesn’t mean that’s his best position for the team. We need a nimble and technical midfielder like Naby Keita.@GaryLineker Let's see if he can do it in the Premier League looks a world beater in Germany but so did Timo Werner and Naby Keita.@sportbible We bought him for the same price they paid for naby keita🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣@TheAnfieldBuzz ALSO:  Naby Keita is a fraud and should never wear a Liverpool shirt again.Guinea 🇬🇳

Naby Keita 80% 

CM, 26, Liverpool@mhardman1978 @henrywinter You signed Naby Keita for more.@freddysageworld @garyalsmith Charley I shock sef 
Naby Keita cost over £50m buh hmm@G7NNA Naby Keita caseAlso I have literally never seen wages factored into the cost of a players arrival until now, Liverpool fans just can't handle that they've bought the best striker in world football for the same price as Naby Keita@City_Xtra @ErlingHaaland @ManCity less than the cost of naby keita https://t.co/QHJaVo76E2@centristjim1 @goal @ErlingHaaland @ManCity Erling Haaland costs the same amount as Naby Keita, less than the likes of Pepe, Kepa, Lukaku, Sancho, Maguire, Pulisic.Less than for naby keita 🤔@TheWiseManAD Bundassliga player with a injury record worse than Naby Keita 😭😭😭😭@bernardooooV3 Naby Keita was more than this? Seriously? Shocker of a buy.@nii_gl @dragon19524 @MohaneshV @ExJo3nHones7y @BarcaTimes @CBSSports We’re more afraid of naby keita more than the Argentine dwarf@_tabies Naaah imagine Naby Keita had her knees bro damn@cityreport_ @FabrizioRomano Almost the same amount as Naby Keita.@DameoPt2 @footballdaily @SkyKaveh £52m for the hottest striker prospect out there is less than what Naby Keita cost. He’s on £350,000 a week, less than what salah will be on. His fee combined with Alvarez fee costs less than Harry maguire. It’s incredible business, teams just need to recruit as well as we do.@siiiiuuuuu9876 @k_Sinzu @Royce_4L @Football__Tweet The 3 midfielders in Liverpool are Thiago, Fabinio and Naby Keïta. I hope Klopp goes for this 3 🤲🏽 Hendo is better when comes on@talkSPORT 800 million spent. 1 premier league title. van dijk - 75 mill, alisson - 70 mill, Fabinho - 50 mill, naby Keita - 50/60 mill, oxlade-chamberlain - 40 mill, Thiago - 26 mill, Henderson- 20 mill, mane - 34 mill, salah - 34 milli, Jota - 40 mill. konate, Diaz… they’ve spent plenty@ShaunlfcT Cost less than naby Keita 🤣@jgedeon1717 @CityReportBen You gonna pay his dad, agent fees, signing on bus.. He is on 300k+.. really cannot compare his costs with naby KeitaYes it's the same about Liverpool and Naby Keita, and now the depth we have at CB. But Pep has been doing this since 2017@annabelfc_ @LFC Who the fuck gets excited about a naby keita contract extension 😭@es_grimes naby keita contract?@bernardooooV3 Why do I keep reading “cost the same as naby keita” by every city fan😭 https://t.co/CXSrOAhC6G@LFCPierre @bernardooooV3 Since when did that get included in transfer talks. Bottom line is, we signed the guy for the same price as below average Naby Keita and he'll be on only £300K a week, less than Bencho and Lakaka. If that's not good business, I don't know what is 🤣🤣🤣🤣@Sxne19iv2 How much is Haaland weekly wages compare to Naby Keita's.@ZiyeshG Tbf Naby Keita cost as much as Haaland@Tsimi_SZN he cost the same as u bought naby keita for😭😭😭😭@empireofthekop Rather see naby keita go them him but think both should go and some new mids come in@sportbible Haaland costed the same as Naby keita@thisisanfield They bought the wrong Naby Keita??@FPL_96 @fullback03 price is the same as lfc paid for naby keita, LFC love to hate on others spending but remain silent about their own. City have sold players to fund their spending aswell &amp; are looking to sell jesus to recover the haaland money, lfc are butt-hurt trolls who love to play the victim@LFCFI @Thekinghimselfx @Ben00238336 @AnfieldWatch Ah yes, VVD was from bootle, grew up in the academy, certainly wasn't the record signing for a defender, same with Jota, think he was from Birkenhead actually, and who could forget little Naby Keita, scouse born and bred. You'll never catch Liverpool recruiting players!@Sheogor45122702 @jumpyknight @ShaunlfcT Naby Keita cost how much?@bbccheah @ShaunlfcT Naby keita was 70 mil.jalanf not even our highest earner@bbccheah @ShaunlfcT He costs less than naby keita@chadsmith71 @GoalPoacher_ I'm using gold llornte alongside prime Matthaus at cdm in 352....I'm not sure whether to do Alli or just buy Jordan Henderson fut captains card@MarkEUFC It seems that some people are confused about who will be captain for Liverpool next season. Jurgen Klopp has not confirmed that Jordan Henderson will be captain going forward, while Pep Guardiola has not confirmed that David Silva will be captain going forward.After receiving treatment on the pitch, Fabinho limped off before being replaced by captain Jordan Henderson on the half-hour mark.

📸Getty Images https://t.co/fTfKFnFQdu@henrywinter Jordan Henderson is John moses love child (Sunderland boys stick together)@LFC Jordan Henderson 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 you got to be joking@TheRedmenTV I am going for Jordan Henderson thought he came on and controlled the midfield@babuyagu I've said many times that Jordan Henderson is the best defender of space that I've ever seen. His positional awareness is simply astonishing.@thisisanfield Can I just point out how crucial Jordan Henderson was - again. He is a colossus when needed the most and an outstanding leader that has been fundamental to our success during this era #YNWA @LFC_Australia@SkySportsPL I just can’t stand Jordan Henderson tbh@BBCSport Jordan Henderson mates with Adam Johnston so….@JayMotty Let’s take a moment and recognise a true Liverpool legend … Jordan Henderson the only Liverpool captain in the 20th century to lift the EPL title … he is the greatest Liverpool captain of all time … fact@us3rzz Pogba got rocked by Jordan Henderson he is a better player@lottelydia It’s douze points from me to Jordan Henderson@laligafarmers @ChrisSilveste14 @mufcMPB @BILD Is Jordan Henderson a Liverpool level player? Does he do his job well? Do you watch UCL football involving Leipzig?@sidlowe Also superficial, but I don’t think Jordan Henderson’s shorts fit properly. Seem a bit drainpipe-y, like a Bash Street Kid. Once you see it…@thecardstipster Lucas Digne and Jordan Henderson@paul_grech You say that, but I don't think he's been very good for the last few months other than a one off.  If you're telling me henderson, thiago, keita is our midfield in the cups I'm not exactly freaking out.  It's not ideal but we need Thiago and Jordan more IMHO.@CouchNish 1) Jon moss can’t move out the centre circle and 2) Jordan Henderson👍🏻👌🏻#LFC got better (more controlled) when Fabinho went off. Chaos is the last thing they need and Jordan Henderson has helped with that. Still plenty of time for the Reds to improve again.@steviemac2010 He's a well known Sunderland fan. Loves Jordan Henderson. Go figure@Magpie24_7 Henderson would be my pick, he was brilliant when he was playing for Sheff Utd a couple season back.@LFC Game over as soon jordan Henderson came onYep. Jordan Henderson on for the injured FabinhoA worry for Liverpool? Fabinho limps off injured and will be replaced by Jordan Henderson. 

A thrilling game at Villa Park so far.

Slipp G is a Poor Mans Mark Noble🤝🏾@LadimusPrime 😂 He probs heard that he was a poor man's Jordan Henderson and lost it 😂@vaaneessaa22 Then my last change, Jordan Henderson and Andrew Robertson.

Each was club captain when they won the league. For Hansen: 30 years ago. For Henderson: 30 years later💪 https://t.co/GcrTh5ukqz@ahmedIfc @LFC James the clown Milner will get it first because it’s been reported by lying Liverpool journalists that other clubs want him just like they did with Jordan Henderson@ismailiqbal26 @StevenGerr8rd @brfootball A Liverpool Fan Sees Jordan Henderson (Liverpool Player) On A Cover and Goes Wild.@LFC @AVFCOfficial Jordan Henderson is not playing

That’s crazy@Pxtrlk @LFCTransferRoom @FabrizioRomano Give up.. we have Jordan Henderson we need an upgrade@buysheep @babuyagu I'd be Lallana from 2018-2020. Comes on for 5 minutes every month, gets injured. Co-ordinates all the entertainment and parties. Always doing the PR for the club even after I've left. Slightly homoerotic relationship with Jordan Henderson.@GoffVanGeoff @LFC_LION The guy has a weird obsession with Jordan Henderson. I bet he has pictures all over his bedroom of him. If I was Hendo I would get a restraining order against him.@Jonny_Mc06 Wonder if he gets to hold Jordan Henderson's hand@Evanaell @AnfieldEdition @TheAthleticUK Having Salah is still a threat to teams, having Henderson in there is a threat to us@AnfieldEdition @TheAthleticUK Move him on and move Henderson into Milners current role 👍@HarveyS21152572 @midastouchviews @utdcynical @MightBeDom I have not let Pogba down. He is shit. He is paid millions to play to the best of his abilities.

Do you watch football?

If you think Malang Sarr, Loftus-Cheek Christensen are first team players than honestly seek help.

Literally Silva and Rudi got rested for Manu.@barcacentre Lool andreas christensen una@FabrizioRomano Barcelona are on it.
