Mason Mount stamps on Cedric Soares https://t.co/OjCOXtzNnm@ehbenj Just please don’t come in for Cedric Soares or Nuno Tavares. They’ve been key to all of our successes this season.@GPv3000 Someone tweeted this because of CEDRIC SOARES btw@sportbible I am an arsenal fan and I think its a fair call, simply because cedric soares is just useless and he gave the referee a free call@SevenMillionn Arsenal was predicted to finish 7th/8th this season tho... this is a massive overachievement especially with Cedric soares and nketiah in the team@Arsenal coach pls rob holding should  be sold out of the club him n soares cedric d both of dem has cost us dis match.@PeggzAFC It was soft but not soft enough for var to overturn
You don't give the ref an option to give pens or reds these days, you behave. 
Rob holding and Cedric Soares did not.@soccerdiva Gotta ask why you would put Rob Holding and Cedric Soares together on the same side as Son. That is beyond naive.@Viqforlan Cedric soares is always doing that rubbish@CFC_Omondi Arsenal fans are blaming Cedric Soares because they think he is to blame for the loss against Holding. They think he should have done better defensively.@FPLProfessor_ It's seems like Anyone playing against Cedric Soares will be a hero 😂@AAllenSport If you thought Rob holding and Cedric Soares would do it for us you have a real problem. Fucking useless players@Arsenal But why would u start Rob Holding and Cedric Soares against @SpursOfficial @Arsenal is the enemy to self really.@FBI I heard that Cedric Soares and Rob Holding are part of YSL!1!1!@icandoakickflip Yes, Cedric Soares@Arsenal fashi making a striker your priority for next season, pleaseeeee just find a way to make sure Cedric Soares never plays for us again🙏🏾🙏🏾 Thank you@Arsenal Cedric soares gets poorer and poorer each gameCédric Soares gives the ball away very cheaply and allows Harry Kane to get loose on the edge of the box.

Takehiro Tomiyasu blocks the initial shot and then Emerson Royal lashes his shot wide.

⚪🔵 1-0 🔴⚪

#AFC #PL #COYG #TOTARS #THFCvAFC #NLDCedric soares one of the worst defender ive seen, that is a banter era inter player playing for one of the richest club in the world@nonewthing just want to say, respectfully, fuck cedric soares@Arsenal Another 90mins of watching a horrible Cedric Soares😭😭@AFTVMedia Cedric Soares better up his game today!@Betfair Harry Kane to score or assist
Cédric Soares to be carded@masa_chin_ko @SkySportsPL Son 🏃‍♀️ Cedric Soares?😭😭@iamzeezaga @Afcnigerian You shouldn’t view Soares as our long term plan., it obvious he remain in the team due to shortage of players in his position and for his hard work when Tomiyasu was injured,Cedric is not better with his crosses and his final decision making., my opinion@RuhindayoCris @tu_shillah @Evelyn_Nakayi @AlianahSanyu @MukundaneAble Cedric Soares is the guy@IDGoonerscom Cedric Soares@mainneli_ Do you trust Cedric Soares against Spurs ?@onlyspurs As a city fan I despise Livarpool and hope they only end this season with the carabao, despite Chelsea and Madrid destroying our UCL hopes 2 years in a row 

But they won that game fair and square after the offside goal and all we should blame Danny Ings honestly 

Vintage Werner@AmBigSerge @abolerkale @sportbible Jota is shite… he’s an ordinary player… Danny Ings us better than Jota ha ha ha@Jhdharrison1 @SkySportsPL @premierleague @LFC Not being funny but Danny Ings touch inevitably allows Allison to smotherThere's no fucking way people actually believe that any club is signing Haaland just to pay him 150k-200K . 
That's what Danny Ings is earning at Villa@JamesPearceLFC Some might think stevie might not want these players get a second premier league 
Danny ings as well 🤣
See will they turn up against City.@LFC Danny Ings@Pac_NOV4 @JamesPearceLFC Onside according to Jaime Carragher but yet he thinks that Danny Ings was offside when he was inline with Matip when Ali bailed us out@TheRedmenTV Danny Ings. 😂@footballdaily If Danny Ings actually took his chances and Coutinho stopped slipping every time he got into a good position then they probably win this game tbh.@danbardell Maybe. The best sides force those errors though don’t they, and take advantage when they come. I mean, who can plan for the centre half popping up there? If we, as in Danny Ings, had been more clinical we’re spinning a very different yarn tonight. Positive overall, for me.After that we looked good for a while but Danny Ings started to get dangerous and even scored an offside goal, after that the game slowed down and we got the win.@Berdan08914685 Disagree. Danny Ings was close several times... Watkins had a couple of chances. We had opportunities. Compared to many games this season, it was a comparitively okay performance. Yes of course in the grand scheme of things, we need to sort the squad out, but wasn't the worst.@TomLiversage If Danny Ings had a left foot you’ve got at least a point out of that@AVFCOfficial Danny ings deserved a tonight@SeanDOlfc @rajsinghchohan Jota is one ACL surgery away from being Danny Ings@TheHandsom3Kyle Did you not see Danny Ings finish?Danny Ings? Have you heard of a left foot? 
Then to top it all off Mings as per usual can't stay in position, charging in way too much leaving a gulf of space in behind when there was no need to do it! 
2 CB's, 1 CF, 1 DM in the summer end of. Time to lose the useless deadwood@Kardie_M Offside goal by Danny Ings@IcebergKanon1 @City_Xtra Missing Danny Ings@TheRedmenTV Danny Ings had the game of his life there. Tried his absolute hardest to score against. Watch him shit the bed against City and roll overDanny Ings you too akh@HassanNatha And Danny Ings@noti5h44n 1) we played a rotated squad and 2) this danny ings? https://t.co/Nq0hsVXbe1@iLatif_ Danny Ings, Coutinho and Gerard all has signed some paperworks

Cus Villa should have been leading by now@footballdaily If villa got proper striker, it's easy draw. Danny ings missed alot of easy chances@istanmufc Danny ings thinks he’s still at liverpool@tesh1224 Agent Danny Ings did his part 😁@PastyCully67 @CridlandAndy @stocksy66 @JamieCottrell @buzzhawk34 @gliddon_jamie @DeanoDeansilvo We went out Howard back.

The Ref also had a good game for liverpool. come on @ManCity dont let them win!@AVFCOfficial This is on Gerrard , Buendia and chambers should have started , Konza and mings need selling and Danny Ings needs to remember he doesn’t play for Liverpool anymore ... and don’t get me started on that twat in the black@floyangu Can't get over the misses by Danny Ings... 😭😭😭@TheVillaPodcast New weeks wages fine: Danny Ings heavy touch into the keepers gob@AnfieldWatch Danny ings… 😏Nervous #win by #Liverpool .

He has not been good today.@Paulmcgrath5 Paul , what the hell is Danny Ings at. Very strange performance from the ex Liverpool man.@Siddall1989 Watching Danny Ings is like watching an episode of Laurel &amp; Hardy.@TheWorthingRed Either that or Coutinho has forgotten how to play football and Danny Ings…well, he’s just being Danny Ings I guess. 🤷🏻‍♂️@oliveKubmite Because half our fanbase are full of mad people 😭😂😂 K'oloun saanu fun mi.

I've seen all sorts - Ivan Toney (who I rate BTW), Danny Ings, Richarlison

Vomit inducing. 🤮@sidlowe "Sid Lowe asserts Danny Ings"@theanfieldread It literally just happened with Danny Ings after Alisson came out to win the ball.Why does it feel like Danny Ings is trying to get back into the Liverpool squad?
