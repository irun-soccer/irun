#Rooney #Vardy #LibelcaseMr Sherborne then tells the court about an article that appeared in The Sun, headlined "Wayne Rooney tells Jamie Vardy's wag Rebekah to keep lower profile ahead of England clash with Iceland".

#wagathachristie@georgiebingham @Lawton_Times There were a couple of high profile LCFC stories in the period after they won the league. I bet everyone is now thinking they know exactly where they came from, nobody will trust Jamie Vardy again.She says she never wanted to rely on her husband.

Mr Sherborne refers to a column dated 19 June 2016, headlined "Dream Come True: Jamie Vardy's wife Rebekah says husband was 'buzzing' after his Euro 2016 goal against Wales".He is telling the court about this article as Vardy has been accused of trying to gain publicity during the tournament, which took place in France.

She tells the court she was there to support her husband, Jamie Vardy, who was on the England squad. https://t.co/gD0j5Mqr30@guardian Feel sorry for Jamie Vardy, She’s gonna end up costing her husband a fortune in court costs.One of them is a picture-led piece which features a photo of Vardy with the journalist, Simon Boyle, at the home in Leicestershire that she lived in with her husband Jamie Vardy at the time.

Mr Sherborne tells the court of more articles about Vardy in the Mirror in May 2016.There was an exclusive interview on 6 May 2016, headlined "Behind the scenes with Jamie Vardy's fiancee: We're not next Posh and Becks", followed up by stories on 7 May and 8 May 2016.@DailyMailUK Vardy would sell out her own. SHE sells stories, gets called out for it (rightfully so) then turns round and sues Coleen for outing her! You just can't make this up!

Or are you just still crying over that spectacular half volley?@gxbriellahowell Jamie Vardy is more of a premier league legend than this man. And has had more of an impact in English footballShe is also said to have allegedly leaked info about Mahrez leaving Leicester. No one in that club will speak to Jamie Vardy ever again. She’s wrecked herself and her husband.🗣️ | @Block5FPL
With Watford already relegated and missing a few of their key player, and Chelsea possibly rotating after a cup final, a Leicester asset seems to be a decent shout for captaincy.
Jamie Vardy anyone? Given that security of minutes is an issue for all players.Drinkwater was also a former Leicester City player who had played alongside Vardy's husband Jamie Vardy.

Mr Sherborne says to Rebekah Vardy in court that despite knowing Drinkwater, she was prepared to leak a story on him.@MailOnline What a shame for Jamie Vardy. His wife has shown herself to be nothing better than an old boiler after discussing another mans genitalia.The reason Vardy didn't want it coming back on her was because it would have been obvious it came from the dressing room and Vardy's husband Jamie would have been unhappy about this, Mr Sherborne says.

Vardy says she disagrees.@LukeClutterbuck WTF was Jamie Vardy doing marrying this gold digger.@LiveLCFC Given she's not at the training ground, who leaked this story to her? It's..........Jamie Vardy!Let alone how Jamie Vardy can stay at Leicester but also why any club would trust him to be in their dressing room?@massivecunt100 Wayne Rooney &amp; Jamie Vardy's wives! Literally dominating the news atm ffs!! 😂😂😂 Like nothing else is going on atm is it!! https://t.co/1nJKdHoW2M@GaryLineker Would you call it 'utter nonsense' if Jamie Vardy or Gary Neville said the same thing? #racismVardy is being cross-examined over whether she leaked info to The Sun that “the lads were fuming” that Riyad Mahrez was failing to show up to training at Leicester City, where her husband Jamie Vardy plays

She admits she did discuss it with her agent but it was “just gossip”Vardy is asked if the info came from the Leicester City dressing room, which included husband Jamie: “Did you or did you not know that the 'lads were fuming'?”

She said it was gossip "I had heard and overheard".

“Jamie and I never discussed whether ‘the lads were fuming’”.@Wishfullthinki9 Would be brilliant if derby signed Jamie vardy@JuliaHB1 Who are Leicester playing this weekend ?

Shockingly, it's easy to score a pen (especially when you have Harry Kane) and pass around the back 3 at home.

If he gets his targets I think they can become the most tactically stable team in the league outside L’pool &amp; City whilst having Harry Kane + Son to boot.

After all Harry Kane did it last season.😤😤😤@tribeancestor So Harry Kane will end career at Spurs….@officialridadex @AFCAMDEN That's a clear penalty. He backed SON and he didn't jump. That's a foul tbh.

Remember, Rob Holding or Bellerin did exactly the same foul to Harry Kane or SON at the Emirate and it was also given as penalty. ( I can't recall the season)@ahmednasirlaw Harry Kane takes arsenal exactly where he wants them to be

Christiano Ronaldo has scored 36 goals in 87 games.
It also took Harry Kane almost ten years to make more goals than Messi against Big 6 despite him playing in the UK every year.

Nice try though.@Foooootball2 @FantasyFooty442 @FPL_Harry Was never going to take a pen tonight, whilst the top 4 is on Kane is 100% taking them.@LionofGlencoe I had a very tasty win on a Harry Kane header tonight !👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻@luchonani @brian_ovo Current settings and Add

The answer is literally no one

Abeg no your fact and come back harder … thank you Jon 🤝@Wattsyy__ @SulloReport the first yellow son is the one putting his body into holding and blocking him from be able to do anything (harry kane esk) and somhow he gives you the free kick plus a holding yellow and the body check off the ball should’ve been his first yellow. plus the pen is a disgrace@leebobo1972 @That_Food_Guy @piersmorgan Now where is Conte with Harry Kane and Son. Give Arsenal Kane and see them sweeping all trophies@bsmithnewton So, Harry Kane made three fouls in quick succession and there was no debate about a yellow.

Show me then, where is the elbow. You clearly have no idea what you're speaking about 

Cowardly players? You're team was carried by a refereeing corruption. Now that is cowardice.@SpursOfficial Arsenal fans can't accept defeat. Congratulations 👏👏 Harry Kane 😂@Tams_THFC For me, it's his first one, when the Scorpions Harry Kane song ceased being ironic.

Volume. https://t.co/GeiWU16mD7@solbloke @RequestABet He could well do. I also think that by the time it becomes a possibility, England’s most capped player will be either Raheem Sterling or Harry Kane. Both could realistically pass the 125 record@SpursOfficial 21 - Son Heung-min has scored 21 non-penalty goals in the Premier League this season, with only Harry Kane ever netting more goals, excluding penalties, in a single season in the competition for Spurs (28 in 2017-18 and 24 in 2016-17).

All comes down to the last 2 games now. Cant stand Harry Kane so smug@afcevan No no the ref was always gonna be their insurance policy.  See how quickly he gave that 2nd yellow.  Not a moments hesitation over a bread &amp; butter basic defending you see multiple times in EVERY match.  Harry Kane was quick to instruct the ref to book Holding.

Can he score a Hattrick?🤔

#TOTARS@SkySportsPL Martin Tyler is one more Harry Kane blowjob away from a strokeLast time Arsenal got top 4 they drew 2-2 with a man sent off at Spurs. Harry Kane was one of the goalscorers.

Listen harry kane interviews and if that doesn't work out...write RATIO! and come@OJOBAMIJI I rate him, he's a great player. But not winning a trophy for spurs is unforgivable and that has affected his legacy. That's my point.

Harry Kane is the only too stroker I know that hasn't won a single trophy for his side and he's almost 30.Harry Kane has just 3 G/A in his last 5 starts while Son Heung-Min has been in form with a total of 8 G/A in his last 5 👀@FPL_Harry Be ready to see Kane letting Son taking the penalty.@kellyhonour Diaz has more trophies than Harry Kane 😂😭@FrankKhalidUK Sign Harry Kane.

But Fab is a DM, and Harry Kane or any WC striker scores that with his eyes closed 👍@amitttrmfc So last season Kevin De Bruyne scored 6 goals 12 assists and he won POTY despite Harry Kane scoring 23 goals and 14 assists because we won the PL so why Salah deserves this season for scoring 22 goals and 13 assists when Kevin De Bruyne scored 15 goals and 7 assists@thespursweb There is no need for a big name striker mention one big name striker that isn’t old and is better than Harry Kane, if Harry is still in Tottenham all we need is a youngster  23-27 who can substitute for HK and produce 70-80% of HK presence when on pitch.@thfcsxn what a match-winning performance in a final to win his first ever trophy for harry kane!@its0kaybabe Remember Mourinho always used to do the same with Harry Kane lol@Sinno68 Got to look at who you're up against as well, it's been said about Van Dijk apart from Harry Kane there are no great PL strikers in todays game.

But, “Alright Mate” it has to be the Teesside lighthouse for me. 

Dael Fry: P36 | G1 | A2

Super Sol was immense. But, when Dael got home from Old Trafford, he emptied his back pocket and found Cristiano Ronaldo. He then did the same to Harry Kane.

See Harry Kane, who wanted to leave for City last year, but wasn’t able to as his contract meant Spurs held all the cards.These are Harry Kane’s assists this season. It’s basically the pass map of a number 10 and it’s pretty clear where the danger lies.

Harry Kane loves Tottenham and he was not just offered 6 years contract, he SIGNED 6 YEARS contract and guess what he wanted to leave last summer
We are not forcing him, Ten Hag is convincing him with his project that’s two different things@AlanDeaton7 On current form I think he plays Saturday, but I don't think I can trust him to deliver week in week out. 

I hate to admit it, but Harry Kane continues to put in a shift every game, without a single medal to show for it.

Wouldn't have been an icon skin I'd ever have expected yet they did it@AlasdairGold Harry Kane is the best@SxrgioSZN I mean if Harry Kane would have been a midfielder I would have argued but no one atm tbh!@sportbible Hugo Lloris

Luis Suarez@looking4lookman @Lwazii_711 @Football__Tweet RVP had a good 11/12 &amp; 12/13 season, he was in the premier league for 11 seasons carried by Henry at the start and Rooney at the end. Prem titles doesn’t come into the debate, Harry Kane will go down as the best striker in Prem history without winning a thing. https://t.co/ih2X3EOJId3.

Watford keeper Ben Foster's 21/22 end-of-season prediction: "very quiet transfer window...big loss losing Ben White...Brighton will finish in 18th place"

How's that working out, mate? https://t.co/cy0dqlFQRa... and Ben Foster kept a clean against Everton so my opponent at the current stage made 120+ pts 🤦 bye bye dreams for an FPL trophy 🤪

At least I broke into top 200 k. Poor performance this season but it is what it is. Bring the new one already. https://t.co/CIWWdfeuiE@TheEvertonEnd Spent 85% of the season booing your own supporters then decide to give them a bit of support the last 3 games, it’s laughable. Even Ben Foster was laughing at the Everton fans 🤡@GabSutton Not massively, which I’m guessing is part of the reason we’re so bad. Lot of newbies and a manager every 2 weeks doesn’t help the situation. Also, I hate the above the blame on one player but Ben foster vlogging in training every day probably doesn’t help either.@NobodyButNori_ i sideyed this great white hype film from jump. lol i will say Ben Foster being in it had me interestes. cause he ACTS lol@KevMorrissey8 Ben Foster was seen recording his video logs during the game, only needed one glove on. Had his phone in the other@LetsTalk_FPL Ben Foster clean sheet + bonus!@talkSPORT Danny Mills, Ben Foster. Aren't experts wonderful. Remind me, where are Leeds and Watford right nowCan’t keep defending him no more, probably worst shot stopper in the league alongside Ben Foster@_EH_9 Keita clear origi clear of haaland moreno clear of cancelo ederson worse then ben Foster, foden is just a English iwobi city nothing but a oil team with zero fans now ima go cry because I hate city@OthersideMleta The second wave is coming! @arias_avlis @rafadiosilva @MdAkash1561 @dryvs50 @Jose47329944 @heyimkip @therealkevrich @Trade_bird @aMikeGreen @AverageJovi @AmtVerse @Ben_W_Foster @cryptopyro_guru @1Bossup@afcmase_ Well obviously ben Foster might put this one on his youtube channel you know what I mean     but no seriously we're

Just hope the Everton fans let Ben Foster know our thoughts on his views about us as supporters UTFT@louorns De Gea is basically becoming Ben foster@thechewbecka @LisaMartinImage A 76ers movie where Thybulle shares a scene with my lieutenant boy Ben Foster?!? Could not be more in!@AdamSandler Ben Foster, more Megamind than ever.Film #115: Leave No Trace

Interesting enough film but it does seem a little meandering at times. Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie are terrific in it though and keep the film engaging enough. #2022Film https://t.co/ylkiW9pROy@AdamSandler I can't wait for this!
