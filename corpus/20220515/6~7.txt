When Pep first come, he wan die. Ademola Lookman dribble the whole team, score. 
For ETH, e fit be Iwobi@OfficialOurbet His father is a Nigerian, so definitely one day if he decides to play for Nigeria, he can without any issue. Look at Ademola Lookman as an example.@CFCMethod @c_nk97 Another Ademola Lookman is all I see.. lol@osowxvyy Kulusevski is not even better than *Ademola Lookman@MikePotts75 I think he could come good but then I thought Angus Gunn would too.@NorwichCityFC I mean Angus Gunn….sheesh@paddyjdavitt @FocusImagesLtd @paulhc64 Absolutely loving Angus Gunn playing a blinder.

Angus going a long may to make a big point so far.

This really is Sam Byram's revenge arc. Except not really because VAR is about to rule this out.

Son is in very good form for us and can prove to be dangerous against Aaron Ramsdale who has gained criticism for his positioning. Odegaard and Nketiah can combine to create and finish chances against Lloris.@learmouthh @m_tactician Given that there are no stats to go by other than their PL goals conceded over appearances, you can't legitimately claim that Aaron Ramsdale has conceded fewer goals though, can you?

Eddie Nketiah - Player To Have 1 Or More Shots On Target
Cristian Romero - Shown a Card
Gabriel Magalhaes - Shown a Card
Son Heung-Min - To Score Or Assist@AFTVMedia Can someone please tell Gabriel Magalhaes to stop showing jetters in big games. He's a good defender, he just needs to calm down@torozco I’m really sorry. It’s not intentional. I’m awful with certain pronunciations and not just names. Portuguese names are often tricky for me (Gabriel magalhaes is an example). But again, this isn’t intent. It’s just hearing it wrong in my head@luckybeting 2x1 Tottenham

Echoes@HowNeilFeels @CalebPongratz10 They lost Joao Pedro for the year. Morris &amp; Lodeiro will get hurt at some point because, well, that's what they do &amp; the West looks like a more difficult road at this point.Wolves:  Sa, Boly, Coady, Chiquinho, Jonny, Dendoncker, Ruben Neves, Joao Moutinho, Ait-Nouri, Jimenez, Pedro Neto.

Subs: Ruddy, Hoever, Marcal, Toti, Cundle, Fabio Silva, Hwang, Trincao, Mosquera. #WOLMCI@Philatty Kalus never started for them so he’s 100% scoring. Joao Pedro the only good player in that lineup@TheFPLPrince Unfortunately João Pedro Junqueira Jesus is going to ruin your evening. Apologies in advance.@J_1878a Joao Pedro will probably score@crispykreme18 @chentrails @lvftoo There was this meme here in Brazil “JOAO PEDRO” and he asked people to send him songs… and mostly alternative music… so he listened and would be like “ what songs are those” and the are those became a huge joke here in Brazil@paulberry2303 He can send Wolves Joao Pedro on a free if he wants.@FPLSteve Ederson

Wow, more than I thought@pedro_santosszs tmb estou ...@mattwall88 @TomRogers24 @kingscrossed Kamara, Louza, Dennis, Etebo, Sarr, Cucho, Joao Pedro are the only ones for me worth something at a higher level. Sierralta maybe as wellDirected by João Eça under the pseudonym Pedro Henrique, FRÁGIL was the festival's most controversial screening. Trying to look past the polemic, I wrote about this explosion of insincere sincerity, performative rebelliousness in 50 shades of neon.

The Argentinian goalkeeper has kept 11 cleansheet in the Premier League this season including 2 in his last 3 games. 

Averaging 2.7 saves per 90, but is likely to make quite a few more saves in this game.@UTDkingsley Tomori is way too good, he isn't even supposed to be called up ahead of his own CB partner Ezri Konsa@JohnTerry26 @JohnTerry26 would you recommend Chelsea to sign Ezri konsa?@Loxlcfc Ezri Konsa mad to be signed up by the Reds then 😂@GPDecorating I kept thinking why McGinn wasn’t going for the ball then realised it was actually john Moss@JackGrimse @itsssbreezy Not only that he was always in the way of play, stood in the way of Douglas luiz starting a counter attack and John mcginn, let way tomany fouls go unpunished and made many questionable calls@fdematch There’s been loads over the years, for example Kenny Dalglish, Jimmy Johnstone, Paul McStay etc. Wouldn’t say John McGinn is even the most technical Scottish player atm either. That title probably goes to Callum McGregor and/or Billy Gilmour rn.@thecardstipster John McGinn and tsimikas@mirrensaint @PandaC1987b I think he would be as even the young kids coming through would relate to him and there the John McGinn factor@ballsdotie Douglas Luiz and John McGinn would like words...or would they? They can't decide.John Mcginn is Mctominay with a better ass.John McGinn is looking a bit pigeon chested there. :D

Another scramble in the VIlla box. This one cleared. Game been a bit like that so far.

Add it to your betslip here: https://t.co/TOzfup1TZp https://t.co/0TRH2SvX6w3) MID - John McGinn:

John McGinn is guaranteed to deliver both attacking as well as defensive points. He has 3 goals and 3 assists and averages 30 passes completed per 90. 

He also has an impressive 4.67 tackles + interceptions per 90.@TheFergusonWay They’ll buy John mcginn@DanielGarb @talkSPORT @alanbrazil As bad Tom English saying John McGinn isn’t worth 1 and half million and wouldn’t get into the Celtic team.@BraydenL99 @allan_822 "How players from each country have performed abroad."

What Aussies have done better than Andy Robertson, Kieran Tierney, Aaron Hickey, Scott McTominay &amp; John McGinn etc?

You'll need to expand on what you mean from what you've seen from both leagues.👕 Now, let's look at some player stats, shall we? Everyone loves a John McGinn card and between the two teams, no player has committed more fouls this season (50). Regardless of the three Liverpool have in the middle, Villa will have a tough time. Fouls expected. https://t.co/BQm8cZusgY@stopthatfooty @nocontextfooty It's no John Mcginn https://t.co/1RsaVLpSBO@ChampionsLeague John McGinn@FavelaFIair Bertrand traore is a baller@thechelskikid @TheBlueAlphaa @incogtactico @Pulisicate @ChelseaLoanArmy @siphillipssport You are very funny. I follow all Chelsea loan players. This has been a tradition for me. Right from Sinclair, McEarnhan. Bertrand Traore, Kakuta, Mount, solanke, Abraham, Bruma, Mancienne. I can name a whole lot of academy players for you. Islam feruz etc@CallumMCFCDonk @DysonHarry @FootyAccums I mean Real Madrid don’t have the mighty Bertrand Traoré tho so who’s really better@AVFCOfficial tears😭 we need a goal and bring on bertrand traore 🤣🤣🤣Watkins off for Bertrand Traore. Assume there is an injury there as he has looked their biggest threat all game.@dpjp89 @talkSPORT Hardly a coin toss between JWP and Mateusz Klich or Kyle Walker-Peters and Luke Ayling is it mateMateusz Klich dropping out of the XI perhaps not too much of a surprise given he's been substituted at half-time twice in recent weeks. He was successful with just 1 of his 24 pressures during the first half against Arsenal.
