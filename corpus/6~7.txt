When Pep first come, he wan die. Ademola Lookman dribble the whole team, score. 
For ETH, e fit be Iwobi@OfficialOurbet His father is a Nigerian, so definitely one day if he decides to play for Nigeria, he can without any issue. Look at Ademola Lookman as an example.@CFCMethod @c_nk97 Another Ademola Lookman is all I see.. lol@osowxvyy Kulusevski is not even better than *Ademola Lookman@MikePotts75 I think he could come good but then I thought Angus Gunn would too.@NorwichCityFC I mean Angus Gunn….sheesh@paddyjdavitt @FocusImagesLtd @paulhc64 Absolutely loving Angus Gunn playing a blinder.

Angus going a long may to make a big point so far.

This really is Sam Byram's revenge arc. Except not really because VAR is about to rule this out.

Son is in very good form for us and can prove to be dangerous against Aaron Ramsdale who has gained criticism for his positioning. Odegaard and Nketiah can combine to create and finish chances against Lloris.@learmouthh @m_tactician Given that there are no stats to go by other than their PL goals conceded over appearances, you can't legitimately claim that Aaron Ramsdale has conceded fewer goals though, can you?

Wouldn't always have been the case!Yet, despite all these incidents, the elbow today, and the consistent diving/simulation, he is portrayed as this innocent individual who isn't guilty of anything. He's  been sent off as many times as Granit Xhaka (media-portrayed villain) in the last 3 years.Add Granit Xhaka to the list.Lovely ball from Granit Xhaka over to Nuno Tavares, who plays a beautiful first-time cross, which is well met by Martin Ødegaard on the edge of the box, but it's straight at Hugo Lloris.
