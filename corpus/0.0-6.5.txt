a single tear just rolled down aaron ramsdale's face 
didn't sign bruno g or coutinho in january it was because both are joorabchian clients we know neto another joorabchian client isn't going to arsenal any time soon due to the fact they will have matt turner coming in the summer him aaron ramsdale arthur okonkwo and karl 
he keo us in games we would have lost to chelsea and would have been 2 or 3 down to united without him what a star and who is aaron ramsdale who 🤣🤣🤣 
aaron ramsdale has a lot of that 
gk aaron ramsdale ars great value throughout the season particularly first half def no comment taa cancelo mid salah great season until after ko from wcq fwd kane everyone else was quite rubbish hon mentions gk sa def james med bowen fwd richarlison 
here are my season rewards pots heung min son ypots bukayo saka signing of the season luis diaz martin odegaard flop of the season nuno tavares 🗿 underrated transfer marc cucurella manger of the year eddie howe 
so you guys didn't spend millions of pounds on sambi lokonga nuno tavares tomiyasu ben white and ramsdale 🤣🤣🤣 
signed the self crowned goat and another charcoal seller from dortmund to win them games 😂😂ends up marrineted by nuno tavares 😂😂 clowns frauds 
biggest disappointment aubameyang biggest surprise aaron ramsdale biggest hope nuno tavares 
make a good note of this tweet nuno tavares does not have a place in the future of arsenal i wish him the best in his career though 
🇵🇹 nuno tavares 5 10 such a weird player started off so well looked like the perfect kt back up and while being very raw he did well and even kept kt out for a while since the new year he's had very little confidence and some moments where he looks good others he looks awful 
take our best lb nuno tavares 🙏 
how about nuno tavares 
you spent almost as much as united last summer 😂 just because yours was ben white and nuno tavares don't act like you lot don't have money or something 😂 
you're acting like we didn't have to put up with cedric and nuno tavares for half a szn as well😭😭 
mbappe looks at his contract in jan and thinks help psg pick a coach no help arsenal win the europa the prem and play alongside nuno tavares yes 
playing ucl with cedric soares rob holding nuno tavares alexandre lacazette elneny no thanks 
he is shit just as lokonga holding nuno tavares nketiah and lacazette 
however as a fullback i fear nuno tavares needs to learn how to defend 
even nuno tavares bro literally anyone but cedric 😭😭😭 
nuno tavares does very well to break free of everton challenges but as per usual his shot is lashed very far over the crossbar 🔴⚪️ 2 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
really isn't looking like a good performance once again from nuno tavares his final performance of the season has not entirely betrayed the idea that arsenal will need an upgrade in the summer for sure 🔴⚪️ 2 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
he's nuno tavares what did u expect 😭😭😭 
cédric soares and rob holding are good subs for a team who not have much money to spend nuno tavares was a waste of money 
with nuno tavares and cedric starting conceding a goal shouldn't come as a surprise🤷🏾‍♂️ 
nuno tavares you are not a footballer 
i also hope they give zac swanson a few minutes tonight because he's got to be in line for the most bench appearances ever without ever making an appearance award and no one should have that ignominy when the let's generously call him mercurial nuno tavares keeps playing 
nuno tavares utterly lashes a shot over the crossbar at least 20 yards or so 🔴⚪️ 0 0 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
3 years into his tenure on the last day of the season where we can potentially secure top four after £250m spent we have to look at guys like cedric holding elneny nuno tavares nketiah and martinelli in the starting xi unbelievable stuff 
my player of choice is nuno tavares 
nothing heroic when he bought bang average players like nuno tavares soares lokongo etc whilst shipping out guendozi niles torreira saliva etc 
madrid could buy nuno tavares or cedric from arsenal both great fullbacks and you could snap them up for only about 20 30 mil 
just imagine that arteta decided to loan nuno tavares this season after signing him the same fans that are rubbishing the player would make it seem like arteta hates him and didn't want to give him chance saliba will have been roasted by this stupid fan with a just mistake 
losing saliba could be even worse brought pablo mari wanted to give a new contract to mustafi come on what jdp are you talking about i'm the man in charge vibes and hair gel nothing else juego dp with cedric and nuno tavares helped by xhaka and elneny 
these man started asmir begovic 
granit xhaka lets one loose from distance but it is well saved by asmir begović 🔴⚪️ 2 0 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
a very close call for asmir begović as he did a few weeks ago against leeds united eddie nketiah closes down the goalkeeper and this time forces a corner 🔴⚪️ 1 0 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
27' goal martinelli drills the penalty into the bottom corner and sends asmir begovic the wrong way 🌟 🔴 1 0 🔵 arseve arsenal afc 
goal gabriel martinelli who earned the initial penalty sends asmir begović the wrong way and gives arsenal a very deserved lead 🔴⚪️ 1 0 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
gabriel martinelli goes close the ball ping pong around the everton penalty area and falls to the young winger but asmir begović manages to get something on it very encouraging signs for arsenal so far 🔴⚪️ 0 0 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
asmir begovic is starting in goal with a pair of flip flops on and a piña colada in his lucozade bottle

normal service will be resumed in august when i'm allowed to have a go at michael keane again 
he's just slow ødegaard put him in behind and he got caught up with by michael keane 😭😭 
michael keane harry maguire defending right there 
if michael keane gets picked ahead of him that's not easy to defend literally 
another michael keane 
ralf shld never hv been gvn the coaching they should hv let michael carrick or ryan giggs keane take us to end of season 
kdb and haaland transitions against defenders like michael keane johnny evans dan burn virgil van dijk and calum chambers 
couldn't agree more michael keane mark 2 
michael roy keane was average in turin cox all he does is mealy mouth rephrasing of wikipedia articles 
michael keane and juraj kucka remain joint third top scorer for ncfc this season 
he should go out on loan next season he's basically a younger michael keane which is so scary 
precisely his versatility will be called upon whether blues like that or not i recall posting something similar about michael keane before christmas when his touch was midas in reverse saying he would be needed before the season ended and that proved to be the case 
in this impossible scenario i've envisioned i see us scoring from a heavily deflected shot ala plm vs burnley or a freak o g like michael keane vs everton haha i can't see us scoring a well created goal as you've described the xg will be about 0 3 to 3 1 too 
how many of each garment the players will wear i reckon michael keane slumping around with 29 shirts on 
you're not the best player in the world until you prove yourself against michael keane and tryone mings 
changes done richarlison to toney michael keane to sessengon amp zaha to luis diaz the goat

nah you will breeze it like 3 1 just attack jonjoe kenny and its a big chance created

their excitement over demarai gray whom many leicester fans would have piggybacked to his next club did set alarm bells ringing early in the season question is who'd go there to manage if lamps gets the boot dyche might do a job but i'd be amazed if he wasn't employed soon 
that's another demarai gray 
wout weghorst and demarai gray🌚 
snm i think he's demarai gray redmond barnes bowen harrison levels 🤣😅 
enjoy demarai gray then 
sell or keep efc demarai gray 
not as good as demarai gray 
answer demarai gray anno anagram possibly of marriage day definition a person from the school of science everton f c 
doubt he's better than tom davies 
hope that was a token nicety about davies because if we are to progress as a club as much as tom's a evertonian he should not be anywhere near this squad 
much improved today tom gave a real account of themselves defensively keep the group together and they'll build on that 
have conceded 10 goals in the last 2 games tom davies has started so glad this season is over massive clear out needed over the summer to avoid a repeat next season everton efc evears 
after today's instantly forgettable game as lampard came over with the players at the end a final roar came up from the everton fans as city had won and lampard and tom davies were hugging and grinning like you wouldn't believe 
samuel l jackson hank azaria paul rudd tom holland maggie smith jennifer saunders joanna lumley andrew davies 
tom davies' last photo in an everton shirt hopefully 🙏 
am i missing something with tom davies 🤷 
tom davies played that's all you need to know 
definitely post pandemic realisation that rules aren't worth enforcing amp people are worthless won't be long until there's chicken wire reintroduced in the dole offices 
tom davies 😳🧐🙈🙈 
hope that's tom davies among others last game for you 
please someone take fucken tom davies away 
77' final sub isaac price is on for his pl debut replacing tom davies 🔴 4 1 🔵 arseve 
tom davies as jesse pinkman lampard in a hat as walter white… 
his mrs wears tom davies pyjamas 
tom davies is still fucking dreadful 
we have tom davies in midfield 
ah yes the famous tom davies shout an not the fact we're shit 🤣 
tom davies is awful i hope he's not in the squad next season 
tom davies makes sure cedric knows he's there right from the start 👀 
it's great to see tom davies back in the starting lineup hopefully we can put a good performance for all travelling blues and end the season with a smile 
they've missed out tom davies c 's full name 
think you'll be safe mate tom davies will see to that 
tom davies in there so apt 😂😂😂 
i wanna be like tom davies 😂 
glad that dele is starting and tom davies is getting a game but who do we have as left back should've stuck with mykolenko but i guess he wanted to give braithwaite another go and he didn't want to drop holgate keane hope we end on a high 
tom davies too written in the stars 
nahh deffo gonna be a tom davies perfect hat trick 🤣💙 
bring on the tom davies haters 
jonson kenny and tom davies omg 😂😂 
tom davies c has been robbed 
made up to see tom davies back 
made up for tom davies 👊⚽️utft 
tom davies is 2022 😢😭😭😭 
walking penis and bollocks for legs tom davies and calvert lewin gear that 
i'd start tom davies over all of them anyway lampard hasn't seen enough of him and surely if he isn't gone this summer next season is his last if he's barely a bench player 
allan is due an operation apparently and gomes won't be there either that leaves tom davies 
also hope resurgent of tom davies 
he's just tom davies without the skateboard and with shit hair …🤣😉🤗 
yep reminds me of tom davies 😂 only jesting yeah he'd be a great signing he hero worships lampard 🇺🇦🙏🏻 efc💙 
dele alli and the under 23s imo tom davies captain 
tom davies c pulling the strings in midfield dressed in a lovely blue velour trackie 
is tom davies definitely registered in everton's 25 man squad can see him playing today and the last thing we need is play an ineligible player 
sell or keep efc tom davies 
similarly playing a 2 man midfield constantly even up to the point that when doucoure who was the only player with any energy to get about the pitch got injured he refused to change the system and instead told tom davies to play the doucoure role 
the 170m covid loss and the depressed transfer market losses are a fucking joke they are posting losses literally 4 times what everybody else is who were they planning on selling fucking tom davies to barcelona for 100m 
thanks god for that 😴

haha easy game for you boys this once we were safe that was us done i just hope dele alli keeps winding xhaka up

from memory how everton have creatively managed ffp has been discussed on the price of football podcast more than once the first time in relation to how the dele alli transfer was structured and also with regard to their covid accounting 
when you came on the pitch we were 2 nil down then you changed the game around hey bom bom bom dele alli's great 
same line of overrated players like wilshere this guy was supposed to win ballon d'or acc to english media jordan henderson dele alli etc all trash 
would not want to be in that away end when we lose top 4 because of a dele alli og 
so when sterling taa dele alli won earlier it was racism😒 
dele alli and fekir is so good 
if bielsa didn't want players offered to him in january that's orta's failing dele alli and vdb have been poor at their respective clubs so bielsa was right to reject them if he did but those were tabloid reports or leaked by the club 
isaac price has had a growth spurt 
77' final sub isaac price is on for his pl debut replacing tom davies 🔴 4 1 🔵 arseve 
i'd give isaac price a go 
think isaac price is the closest at the moment 
mr thomas isaac please stop preaching morality petrol price in your neighbouring states is example of caring governments you fellows only give gyans 
isaac auto price any trades 
relatively meaningless the difference in 3 points and 0 in our end of season position is anywhere from 1 15 20million a kristoffer ajer aaron hickey or a new contract for christian eriksen 
pontus jansson was the player that reconnected the leeds united squad with the terraces make no mistake about it he's completely right in what he said he was that player for us 
cheers i said at start of season you guys would stay up with ease plus you have the mountain pontus jansson so i wanted him to do well 
i asked one of the staff to get my pontus jansson card signed and he never came back with it 😅 can i have it back please 😂 
odds on a pontus jansson own goal today 
pontus jansson heads away a corner hits tyler on the head rebounds into the net for a last minute winner delirium in the away end tyler wheels away in triumph leeds stay up and we all live happily ever after 😊 
pontus jansson will score an own goal for leeds at brentford only for chris wood to cancel it out with an og for burnley to send down leeds 
what a hero in fairness that's as strong a team as we've got should be easily seeing off burnley just gotta hope pontus jansson still has a soft spot for leeds 👀 
nketiah to score kdb anytime assist b fernandes to be carded pontus jansson to be carded 
right on cue from pontus with every day that passes i become more and more brentford and less and less leeds lufc 
requestabet pontus jansson own goal and leeds to stay up odds please 
imagine pontus jansson scoring an own goal to keep his former team up 😉 
🤔 will pontus jansson send his former club packing jansson to score and leeds to be relegated is 10 1 brelee lufc brentfordfc 
pontus jansson i'm guessing 
89 minute it's eriksen here with the corner for brentford oohh amp pontus jansson buries the header to condemn his old club leeds back to the championship 
imagine how conflicted pontus jansson will be today 
pontus jansson last minute own goal please 
burnley to lose 20 0 thanks to a joelinton masterclass and then pontus jansson scoring a halfway line screamer while trying to give the ball back to meslier to beat us 1 0 with the last kick of the game 
stems back to this game in 2018 
replace 'kevin' with 'sergi canos' he gets a yellow for brentford after excessive post goal celebration then gets red a minute later which are now down to 9 in a 1 1 game leeds united scores in the 93rd minute and avoids relegation 
he's a pro at it tbf my head's gone said to the bloke next to me after he scored that he'll probably do something mindless now because he's sergi canos 40 seconds later he's off

🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 premierleague ▶🇬🇴🇱◀ ⚽ gol de brentford ⏱️ 78' 👤 sergi canos brentford 1⃣ leeds 1⃣ 
sergi canos literally loves scoring against leeds i think i'll kill him one day 
i think robin koch deserves a lot of credit for today's shift he was awesome 
robin koch is way fitter tbh 
robin koch out of position again and worked his socks off very underrated by leeds fans imho 
on the plus side after today i wont ever have to see robin koch or diego llorente plus quite a few others in a leeds shirt ever again 
strong first half from joe gelhardt not even made a single chance he has offered nothing and should have stayed inside rubbish 
let's correct you on joe gelhardt he's not one of leeds united's youngsters he was made at wigan athletic before leeds stolen him for peanuts due to our administration and the inept gerald krasner leeds fan btw wafc 
20th min 0 0 leeds open the scoring via joe gelhardt but var rules it out for offside 
leeds take the lead joe gelhardt gives his team a vital boost in the relegation battle 
calling it now joe gelhardt to score and win the game for leeds keeping the club up and going into automatic club legend status 
joe gelhardt has to make it up here 
should get sangare and yves bissouma to rotate both would cost around 40m all together 
trop fort 
forget about the sanctions start approaching players buy from the prem get me yves bissouma tuchel needs to learn 433 asap this double 6 formation is already failing stubborn coaches get sacked at chelsea if he values the love he has been shown he needs to adapt ktbffh💙 
yves bissouma won't be a bad addition and there are other defensive midfielders out there who are equally or even better than him 
ye funny now sign the deal 
there's also yves bissouma gorgeous player 
should've added did in a follow up tweet we need a new cm if he is clean it has to be yves bissouma 
yves bissouma denzel dumfries frenkie de jong ngolo kante lamptey anthony if the bank balance isn't at a negative don't stop buying 
as in 
use the boot to score not for fancy ffs 
0 0 come on attack goals must be scored we need scores we have to win today go for it 
what's happened to trossard 
one of the best to wear the shirt hope it's not the last time but wish him all the best if it is 💙 
i wanna halfway line goal from him today if he's leaving 
no new kit piss of 
brighton vs west ham watch live via 
no just means we haven't got round to making the kit quick enough 
they've come a long way since the mitre siroccos' that i had as a 12 year old ☺️ 
nice ebay pic 
no new kit 
woah 8 more years on his contract great news admin 🔥 
sign the contract big boy 
might be his last game what a baller though 
announce new contract 
no new kit 🥱🥱🥱 
no new kit 
yes please admin i'll order this aswell as a new contract for him 
show us biss and his new contract 
the last dance 
hmmm seems like a new contract 
have drawn up a shortlist of central defensive midfielders considered a recent problem area and jorginho expected to join declan rice tops the list but tchouameni and yves bissouma also on the list 
gotta be one or the other hey 🤞 
farewell hattrick incoming please stay with us yves bhafc yb4bha 
aston villa targets this summer according to john percy of telegraph are kalvin phillips yves bissouma joe gomez calvin bassey james tarkowski duje caleta car boubacar kamara matt targett morgan sanson bertrand traore anwar el ghazi 
yves bissouma and it's definitely a bad thing 
yves bissouma the brighton midfielder is another long term target with his contract expiring at the end of next season villa offered £25m in january avfc 
well done to leeds for staying up big up coach jesse for fighting till the end as a coach you came in when the boat was almost sinking appreciate you for making patson daka and enock mwepu to be the players they are today love you 🇿🇲 
enock mwepu groin has recovered enough to make the bench subs steele lamptey maupay mwepu lallana alzate duffy offiah ferguson 
team news • enock mwepu could return whilst jeremy sarmiento and jakub moder remain long term absentees • said benrahma could return whilst angelo ogbonna is still out 
jarrod bowen would be a much better signing for you than raphinha imo 
as for striker we first need to see the situation with salah and mane but if they both stay i think we need a backup heir to salah and i'm a massive fan of jarrod bowen but he'd cost a fortune 
jarrod bowen 21 22 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 games 51 🤝 goals 18 ⚽️ assists 13 🅰️ 31 g a's this season is outrageous england call up soon 📞 
so jarrod bowen then 🤔 
jarrod bowen has had a better season than the four english players listed here 
13 jarrod bowen 14 reece james 15 wilfried zaha 16 bruno fernandes 17 jose sa 18 ivan toney 19 marc cucurella 20 diogo jota 21 leandro trossard 22 raheem sterling 23 harry kane 24 james maddison 25 adama traore 
jarrod bowen 
theother14 playmaker award is shared between harvey barnes and jarrod bowen lcfc whufc 
james maddison jarrod bowen 
jarrod bowen 
jarrod bowen looks like a klopp player but west ham will want silly money for him saint maximin has the potential to be very good but could be another adama traore doubt newcastle would sell given their new owners either 
moyes is moyes he's done a better job than every manager we've had post fergie all the others got backed he didn't turned jarrod bowen into a great player found players like soucek coufal developed rice into the player he is and more 
waste of everything money time energy etc☹️☹️ jarrod bowen or any good left footed winger who can replace this guy and pulisic 
jarrod bowen had an amazing season did that lead to many points in your fpl team 
jarrod bowen has entered the chat 
outfield declan rice jarrod bowen michail antonio and pablo fornals all start for west ham this afternoon making their 36th premier league appearance of the season rice has the most starts with 34 the others with 33 starts rice also with most minutes played 3 089 
jarrod bowen will score as west ham send manchester united into the conference league 
salah mahrez kulusevski jarrod bowen just in the premier league lol 
jarrod bowen to score and declan rice yellow card 
i mean we are talking about the great manchester united right getting top 4 should be mandatory no title challenge out of europe in the europa 33points off 1st place jarrod bowen done better for west ham this season goals matter but so too does context 
jarrod bowen hatty incoming bosh 
calm down and comprehend i also mentioned jarrod bowen so its not all about trophies fodens impact and effectiveness on this city team is hard to ignore can he score more he probably should does that detract from his consistent brilliance no 
michail antonio became the all time pl leading scorer for west ham mark noble said he was leaving the club after this season jarrod bowen showed why he should be in the england wc squad 
i agree de bruyne is 100 the best player in the league not sure he is poty though i'd honestly give my vote to jarrod bowen 
jarrod bowen for me 
17goals 7assists with no trophy to show for or a serious title challenge nothing remarkable what he done nothing added to history of his club jarrod bowen this season is more deserving that rashfords 17goals 7assists 
jarrod bowen 👀 
jarrod bowen ⚒️ 
disregarding fix jarrod bowen with fix mason mount others foden maddison saka kulusevski 
jarrod bowen ⚒️ bowen has been one of the stars of the season he is the 4th top points scorer with 204 points and he's on fire right now with 3 goals and 3 assists in his last 3 games west ham will be fighting for europe against brighton and bowen will be who they turn to 
try jarrod bowen 0 3 
son or jarrod bowen 
jarrod bowen is the best english midfielder in the league 😂😂😂 
jarrod bowen with change to spend 
we paid 100m for lukaku to score 8 goals in the entire season while the likes of zaha and jarrod bowen have outscored him 
what was your take on the jarrod bowen signing benrama too i think sometimes you got to take a punt jury still out on benny too 
• jarrod bowen has scored 12 premier league goals this term the most by a west ham player since marlon harewood netted 14 in 2005 06 
pablo fornals 21 22 🇪🇸 games 54 🤝 goals 6 ⚽️ assists 7 🅰️ 13 g a's is respectable numbers double figures assists needed next season 
6 jorginho odsonne edouard armando broja youri tielemans raul jimenez pablo fornals jacob ramsey rodrigo ademola lookman christian pulisic harvey barnes gabriel martinelli danny welbeck 
pablo fornals having the definition of a shocking game so far 
outfield declan rice jarrod bowen michail antonio and pablo fornals all start for west ham this afternoon making their 36th premier league appearance of the season rice has the most starts with 34 the others with 33 starts rice also with most minutes played 3 089 
pablo fornals 
pablo fornals ⚒coyi⚒ 
mixed messages alrite weather he stays or not i think ben johnson has to be startin rb next season i honestly think he has the potential to become great 
gimme jaylon johnson over diggs terrell over diggs slay over diggs bradberry over diggs lattimore over diggs 
i like ben johnson but he is nowhere near as good as coufal not even close for me 
i think he better put on more armour at the plate i think he might be getting plunked a lot 
ben johnson loyal 🇨🇦 🤣 
i had no idea you read ben johnson and also yes let nik come back and we'll bombard her with all these questions 🤭 
pretty sure she was supposed to be han amp leias daughter but then rian johnson came along would have been cool to have rey amp ben as brother amp sister with one being light amp one dark ben coming back to the light would have made more sense too it was dumb making them semi lovers 
not surprised with the assault afterall mancity are famous for assaults it could get worse for kids ben mendy adam johnson barton etc are legacy city players 
vlad brother please don't leave me with ben johnson trying to cross a ball 
years ago when i was riding in the ben johnson celebrity rodeos i would sometimes make some broadway musical references to see who picked up on them i got more knowing responses than i expected 
financial doping man city are to football what ben johnson was to sprinting 
impressive he's better than ben johnson and aaron cresswell 
forgot bergwijn was leaving i like club brugge's noa lang top player with great potential apparently has an attitude problem though and he had some problems with anti semitic chants back up choices from the championship are ben b diaz and brennan johnson 
even my da said it today about yesterday kent blowing out of his arse in the 2nd half like ben johnson in extra time 
yeah and so were lance armstrong amp ben johnson 
congrats to them did what lance armstrong amp ben johnson did well done👍

shows our lack of depth that our game changing subs are ben johnson mark noble and andriy yarmolenko only the club to blame for not strengthening in january still a decent season but it could have been so so so much more

uncle ben i'm always indoors and data is killing me tata 
it wasn't a absolutely terrible trade but i definitely would not have given up eckler and mooney for dionte johnson remember he doesn't have big ben throwing to him a hundred times a game anymore 
primarily because the speed was coming from diontae johnson look i liked juju but it's over now ben in opinion kinda ruined all the wr's he's been terrible the last two years no wr would thrive in the ben's offense 
ben johnson was way better have you read seen epicœcene often called the silent woman it's amazing 
correct there were two goffs last year goff under lynn amp goff under ben johnson amp dan campbell when ben johnson our new oc amp dan campbell took playcalling over goff threw 11 tds amp only had 2 picks in his last 5 games 
goals scorers ryan hughes lewis neal alfie gilmartin keiye williams ben barratt ryan barratt jake johnson olly johnson 2x owen cookson harris dixon assists liam plevin alfie gilmartin x2 ben barratt harris dixon 
i got em 3 3 in the division beating the seahawks jags split against the jets giants beat the panthers and then they should pick up at least one from mia ne phi was team was much better offensively when ben johnson started helping scheme top 5 o line if healthy stay tuned 
johnson repeatedly misled parliament amp the public 9 minutes is irrelevant johnson broke the law the sycophancy from tory mps is contemptible while downing street partied millions were following the law and ben when that meant not being with loved ones in the final hours 
rays affiliates rotations a seth johnson anthony molina mason montgomery patrick wicklander logan workman franklin dacosta il ben brecht a jj goss antonio jimenez ben peoples daiveyon whittle austin vernon il hunter barnhart cole wilcox joe gobillot 
im a republican ben johnson tweet shows the ignorance amp uneducated we have in america he must be on the far right im guessing the far left amp far right don't care about the country they just hate cause the other side will not endorse there extreme non compromising views 
i did it's like listening to ben shapiro another person who tries to justify hate and discrimination against trans people by using certain soft language stop pretending like you support the existence of trans people 
song to celia ben johnson 
walker trent james tomiyasu ben johnson ricardo p lamptey trippier livramento are all better than both dalot and awb 
an apron in ben johnson's studio 
yes they are lance armstrong ben johnson et al their success is down to rule breaking cheating and even then they have only achieved domestic wins that puts them in the same pantheon as linfield besiktas legia warsaw etc oj simpson hired a brilliant legal team as well btw 
petra minecraft story mode ellie the last of us gwen tennyson ben 10 alien force are voiced by ashley johnson 
tim holt was really channeling ben johnson for me very good we all soon realized that the fatal error was splitting the gold up as they went rather than keeping it together and splitting the money at the end but then you don't have a movie 
let's not forget kevin mccarthy kellyanne conway jeanine pirro sean hannity laura ingraham ted cruz ron johnson rand paul ben shapiro donald trump jr eric trump etc 
goff improved down the stretch we went 3 1 with new oc ben johnson and dan calling plays we have weapons everywhere the ol is great i expect jared to thrive 
hi ben hope you feel better soon 
they must have forgotten about adam johnson and gylfi sigurðsson small club mentality 
this is true but i am never buying their subscription i love the peace they did on mark noble 
granted i'm typically one of the most negative west ham fans you'll ever meet constant disappointment but this is a huge summer for us we need to keep rice and bowen and we need to bring in at least 5 players do not underestimate the loss of mark noble in that dressing room 
alright mark you've had a go shown loyalty to your party amp displayed willingness to chuck that 4 176 majority of yours down the swanny some might call that big hearted altruistic noble even some might but their numbers have dwindled as reality has dawned going down 
they called fresh l mark noble 
imagine there's men out there now got no idea in a few months time mark noble is gonna be pulling the strings against em 
if hawthorn are beating geelong and brisbane with newcombe getting 6 votes he wins the rising star daicos cheap kick mark kick mark kick mark with noble in the back pocket means nothing 
no one can ask for more than that well i certainly can't you can keep your stars and your wizards and your generational talents give me a mark noble every time especially when the going is not good especially when the going's not good on my side of the screen 
if you don't watch the english premier league you probably don't know that name names like messi ronaldo maradona and pelé have inserted themselves into general world consciousness mark noble not so much in a way that's what makes his achievements even more special 
i am drinking with mark noble in valhalla now smh 
you got what u wanted a medal 🏅 now ask yourself was it worth th legendary status u had at villa mark noble should how u get treated wen u show loyalty 💯 training ground named after him will always be loved in west ham 4eva will u in man city me thinks not vtid 💯 ❤️👊🏿

• mark noble's first west ham goal came against brighton in a 3 0 fa cup victory in january 2007 • the hammers skipper has faced the seagulls 8 times in all competitions winning 3 drawing 3 and losing 2 in those games noble has 1 goal and 1 assist 
• should retiring club captain mark noble feature it will be his 550th appearance for west ham united the 6th highest in the clubs 126 year history • this would be noble's 414th premier league appearance 
stop attacking mark noble mate and they'll get back to you

pope is mendy 2 0 decent shot stopper but woeful with the ball at his feet wouldnt mind some other burnley players nathan collins mcneil or cornet 
heroes of the day jacky harradonna sergio canos nathan collins villains of the day 
nathan collins mcneil cornet and brownhill i guess 
de los equipos que descendieron destaco a los siguientes como opciones para el everton norwich max aarons watford ismaila sarr burnley james tarkowski agente libre nathan collins nick pope maxwel cornet dwight mcneil wout weghorst opciones low cost con las 3b 
i genuinely think nathan collins would be a great signing for leeds not saying because he's irish i just genuinely think he's a great player 
thoughts on nathan collins to leicester 
a travesty of nathan collins is there next season 
i think we are all gutted lewis we need to build the team around the likes of your josh amp nathan collins although i am astounded that he deliberately handled the ball in the box when everyone knows that var will review it 
certainly agree re cornet he's a baller and we should absolutely pick their carcass for him i'd add young nathan collins to that clearance sale shopping list as well i'm hearing he was at fault for the peno today but better he makes mistakes of youth on their books than ours 
rather go for pope and sell pickford mcneil is overrated and nathan collins looks better than tarkowski and he's younger 
nathan collins from burnley and sell llorente 
for me only the burnley players tark mcneil and especially nathan collins 
nathan collins to leave burnley now 
nathan collins 
nathan collins 
have u consisted nathan collins from burnley irish centre back 
still trying to work out why nathan collins who has been incredible at centre back and stepped to a new level when used in a three lately spent most of the game at right back bonkers 
i think however if we use our brains we should sign a player like nathan collins to solidify the back line 
i'd say someone like moyes or lampard would take a chance on nathan collins 
nathan collins for me been immense for them last few games only 22 as well 
yea yea fair enough i don't know who nathan collins is 
i'm taking nathan collins only and even that's a stretch 
id have tarkowski ismaila sarr that cunt nathan collins think he scored against us and scored another recently i think 
nathan collins for that 5atb yes fucking please 
nathan collins mate 
a premier league without burnley does not feel like the premier league anyways we should raid them for wout weghorst and nathan collins

nathan collins handled a corner callum wilson will take the penalty nufc 
leeds for nathan collins 
yes there's no doubt he has been brilliant for us throughout his time the partnership which him and the skipper have established has been magnificent im gutted he's leaving but makes me feel less worried knowing nathan collins will step into his shoes 
i was disappointed 
as long as they do them justice keep an eye out for the devil is a part timer 2 my isekai life isekai yakkyoku alternate world pharmacy bastard and dr stone ryuusui 
idk it just doesn't have the right voice yknow like it lingers too long on jokes has bits that sound like they are coming from kevin perj rather than the usual disaccociated narrator and overall just revels in its bit way too much 
i thought long and hard sir 
didn't take long did it 
for how long 
it looks like this draft maybe deeper long term than most thought knicks are in position to get a good player that is if they don't take another kevin knox over mikel bridges 🤣 
it's surprising amp disappointing that more people don't connect ge's collapse after welch to his management giant orgs don't fall apart overnight the rot started long before immelt took over 
it's my second favorite 3d mario game it was my favorite for a long time until i played odyssey 
kevin and i are still on good terms so it shouldn't take long 
kevin how long until suri signs for city 
this is a long curly kevin hair appreciation space 
kevin rooney kevin rooney all game long with rick ferraro see what i mean either know your players or kick it back to sam and joe embarrassing 
as long as doesn't turn into a thing like arizonia ended up wit 
yes absolutely kevin o k for instance the local ymca left accuses me of being sex pervert because i appreciate a good long look at the gals in swim wear are we serious here used to be a compliment guess they are sexual freaks not me well see you 
don't feel like getting out of bed tired long walk 
after having watched this franchise for so long nothing would surprise me 
someone's job most likely kevin long was spared today with that win though being held to 1 run or less 11 times is grounds for dismissal especially the way he was heralded in spring training as this hitting master guru 
that hole in your heart will never be filled but makes you stronger in the long run i know from experience there are more than one hole in mine by it will not change who i am and who knows maybe thats my problem either way its better to live and be crushed broken and devastate 
they can be all what they want but as long pep is here and city sign the cream of the crop we are not touching a pl ever again 
idc i wanted the pl more than anything this season as long as city don't win the cl 
julie plec says thisemotionally not a romantic moment like kissing or making love also kevin said that stero's relationship wouldnt last long even if they got marriedbecause they are not soulmate they couldnt get along he saidtheir wishes were very differentstefans soulmate elena 
or you can just take a picture of us thank you kevin you made our very long day worth it 
kevin my symmetrical long term semi arc was touched last week therefore i think you are right we really are close to point of decision gold 
my laptop charger is damaged and i also need a new clipper to continue my barbing lessons 10k would go a long way in helping me achieve these objectives 
i always recommend kevin byard as it is the only jersey i own great leader multi time all pro and most likely a life long titan if you want more flash go henry nothing that could happen could ruin how fans feel about him 
same goes for kevin long as it happens should be playing more regularly but always does a job when called upon 
how long till questions about kevin seitzer start being raised 
ag garland is on long vacation parts unknown 
kevin friend is as close as paul friend has been to the pl for a long time 
mostly goes hand in hand got to get the talent weed out the bums and fragile and then train the talented ones also figure out what they want to do sprint go long go turf etc tons go into it 
while maybe not as urbane hornby's jack to be fair did return holding on to a lot of the character's original ideals amp did so for most of the 80s or at least as long as kevin laffan was associated with the show jack of the 90s isn't the jack of the 80s let alone the 70s version 
and we are losing tchouameni to real madrid it's long 
they avoided the midfield because they were having better luck with long balls over the top considering they played a 5 against a 2 they had no luck at all in midfield 
kevin sorbo is the most ratioed guy on here i am amazed that that he keeps it up so long he will say something preposterously inane and then it is like 95 people dragging him about it he must just be an incredible glutton for punishment… 
we are not touching the pl anytime soon as long as pep is her unfortunately 
so happy for kevin he has been struggling at the plate for so long but i think he has found his groove good for your 
feels so long ago i think i was there was it the kevin kolb comeback and won in overtime 24 21 
that's a fact back when i was buying them from dh it took so long in between releases the one thing positive i have to say is that i really love kevin leahy's translation of the original writing i don't know how the current novel translations are though 
we lost our good luck charm it's going to be long next season 
weinstein cosby louis ck kevin spacey matt lauer bryan singer jeffrey tambor tony robins all faced long overdue repercussions because victims were emboldened to speak up against their abusers yours is an absolutely awful and wrong take on the issue 
release kevin long now 
pep with kevin keegan's long lost brother 
wealth distribution same as it is here and is probably historically related to land ownership from quite a long time ago it takes a while to recover from aristocratic serfdom 
i can see kevin long staying but collins he should leave in my opinion no doubt there will be clubs interested in him this summer 
🆚 burnley 1 2 newcastle united 📋 post game summary 2 3 🏃 kevin long ⏱️ started played whole game 👟 19 23 passes completed 82 60 ℹ️ 1 interceptions ⚔️ 2 3 duels won coybig burnew 
tesla has been overpriced for a long time even elon musk said so also meet kevin is making a mistake rebuying this stock because that is his biggest winner and he believes it will pump again 
soto loves kevin long they should never have let him go did dm not like him keeping soto happy productive is critical 
what a massive assist from kevin de bruyne though he's been rubbish all game long and then pulls that out the bag god damn 
he was 20 seconds off before pu problems and had he not smashed into kevin and f ed his race he may have had a chance again only one crashing at the front is lewis been that way for a long time 
it's been long milan maze 
eee as long as you're taking profits along the way my friend get your roi back 😊 
i think it's every thoughts after the bunny teased the fuck out of us all night long 
bad argument teams would be lining up 4jt it's game 40 i'll bet u by season's end his numbers will be up because of injuries he's also played 2many games behind the plate the whole line up inuding castellanos is slumping imho it's kevin long's hitting philosophy 
same reason all the announcers and analysts said kypreos on fuhr was a clean play in 1996 because they're dumb shills kypreos has long since admitted he turned into fuhr on purpose announcers and analysts got it wrong as they are now 
what webb is gonna see been waiting for a long time 
he can return what he likes as long as he stops fucking up

my guess is the big 3 are in their mid 50's and rebecca is in her early 80's i'm comparing that to my own life as they were the ages of myself and my parents at the start then looking at kevin's kids and guessing how old they are in the future as for how long time has passed 
super excited for their family the jets family just got bigger i want becton in the hof and jets ring of honor one day hall and carter running behind becton will be fun to watch for a long long time 
kevin was stuck in the gravel for a long time there was already 25 seconds between them the next lap and k mag had damage and lewis didn't so no not really interesting 
as long as sj is being analytical he should let us see his patreon subscriber numbers 
notredame 99 to 0 no 84 kevin bauman a junior tight end who had the misfortune of being in the same class as michael mayer but it should still work out for him in the long run 
awwww don't be mean…there's room for everyone to have a career harry is very talented and will have a long career 
i'd click like kevin but i don't not one bit fed up of lying rwnj and their coconspirators i've had enough long ago 😠 
kevin l have it is called red and me it needs re editing long story to this but maybe you just gave me incentive to do it along with our families journeys we didn't just arrive here 💗 i need a place to write with unlimited reliable internet 🤗 
kevin hit lewis at first lap he was p19 for so long 
we've come a long way from kevin elster 
it's a first watch for me and a long time coming i'm excited 
bang kevin long time no see hows ur day 
the democratic congress has to listen to the raving right talk in circles all day long jordan cruz gates marsha nunes kevin mitch boebert marge i imagine working w people who you know conspired to overturn a fair election amp incited their base to break in 
took you long enough to realize 
oh well another long trip up't north for null pont next season 
i even spec'd it a little for comfort back when there were long and short buffs 
cheltenham away wasn't much fun after half time seeing that fucker with his towel raining in the long throw ins and us caving in wasn't a picnic either 
i think you've been wooshed pal it's done in the longstanding style of tongue in cheek political tittle tattle columns that have graced our press for a long long time 
shout out to kevin for telling me how long commercial break i have 
tory skullduggery the ink is hardly dry on the nationalisation of the railways and your on it already strikes were going on previous years long before and its a national ballot please stop spinning 
braeburn so long as they are nice a crispy and a bit of a tart morning kevin x 
sadio mane amp kevin de bruyne each to have over 1 shot on target was 3 1 6 1 as long as they both play i thought this decent value on w hill good luck today pleased with yesterday as i switched the juve game to 1 5 goals 
as long as man city draw liverpool win i agree with you 
she only put into words what we all thinking kevin not so long ago your story was independent scotland couldn't afford to join nato your imagination playing tricks now 
owners well aware that fan expectation next season is top 2 but as a minimum winning the play offs i would take either we have been in this league far too long whilst last season was progress in some areas we were still 11th which is nowhere near good enough 
it's been there a long time so i suspect lots of people stop by 
you either die a hero or live long enough to something something 
talk to him kevin 
blue's clues as long as it's with kevin i wouldn't mind being there 
a bunch of ppl when it was first announced i think it became cooler for ppl when gary v and kevin rose also joined but some ppl don't care if it doesn't instantly put more money in their pocket hard for them to see the long game ¯ ツ ¯ 
still waiting to hear deets of bespoke package scott morrison announced for norco when he and kevin hogan visited its icecream factory in south lismore march 9 not long after bridget mckenzie announced it was 50m and also for other key industry players and employers… 🍦💰🤔 
long live kevin 
they kick the ball long and chase kevin is breaking down defenses game 
ok kevin i'm sorry the leafs lost and your heart is broken you also make a lot of assumption regarding my post all of which are incorrect btw i'd suggest you pull out the golf club and get practicing otherwise it'll be a long summer for ya smashing that keyboard 😘 
i'm surprised it took them this long to pull out the racism card guess they were trying to figure out how to make it fit like seven degrees of kevin bacon how can you connect racism to johnny depp supporters 
kevin long time season ticket holder here very disrespectful to bob who is a legend in the these parts and the cfl just because he retired doesn't mean he can't share very knowledgeable posts about the blue bombers give your head a shake man 
michael tuck dustin fletcher kevin bartlett were all lean and seemed to play for a long time unsure of boomer harvey's body progression 
when kevin started to talk about money 💰 missing from work i was like sir no is this a pending case cuz people go to prison for a long time for white collar crimes 
well as long as we're imagining the worst 
yeah kevin said he was cool with it as long as he doesn't get shoved up his nose again 
it's been so long since i saw a dark comedy that a fully committed to being that all the way through and b knew how dark to go while still being funny 
i say so because i'm at a bar and someone has played 6 straights kevin gates songs i haven't heard this shit in so long and it's way worse than i remember 
there's no way to find the doj is part of our executive branch which biden controls there's zero possibility that a republican controlled congress could interfere with the doj so long as biden is in office 
kevin has been long tsla for 7 weeks that is wild this is the longest string of consecutive weekly losses for the broader market in over 20 years 
we tried to be sneaky for too long 🤣 
hitting mastermind kevin long 
they did not look together at all could not handle the press no pressure no consistent chemistry and resorting to only long balls up the right side there were moments just too few letsgobobcats 
kevin is a big supporter finn is a dear to her sami is also a very dear friend of hers literally i can easily name 3 people who she has a very close bond with and has shared good friendship for a very very long time i'm not even naming the ones she's made after entering wwe 
kevin i listen to a lot of podcasts yours is the first in a long time that i take notes on awesome show comedygoldminds 
it would not be last long 😉 
i think that's the benefit of the bid independent and teal swing will temper the kevin rudd style backdown will also require the greens to be open to some compromises for long term gains 
wwe have a long history of dissing ppl who quit leave remember they dissed hogan kevin bash and scott hall for leaving to wcw they even jade fake impersonations of them to mock them wwe have been petty towards mfs who quit 
you're the real deal kevin hope you are here a long time 
as long as we have kevin rudd's rc into the murdoch trash 
but this year he doesn't have kevin long to help him get out of this funk 
and i miss kevin long 
the list is long… lauren boebert marjorie taylor greene matt gaetz paul gosar kevin mccarthy jim jordan ron johnson ted cruz john kennedy ted cruz bill lee joe manchin basically if they have an r by their name they need to go 
nikki fried is a more serious candidate than kandiss taylor and nikki fried is going to get stomped by charlie fucking crist of course the blue checks would much rather talk about anything but abrams sticking her foot in her mouth 
fuck charlie taylor refused to play for the club for one reason or another 
charlie taylor 
now re buy charlie taylor i say 
charlie lana and taylor 
10 years ago we should have signed charlie taylor too 
radz charlie taylor please and thank you 
charlie taylor who refused to play for leeds to force a move through 
despite the past charlie taylor would be a great signing for leeds let's get it done lufc mot 
fook it bring back charlie taylor too and piss off the yer da's 
if we're going burnley and being realistic charlie taylor on a free would be a good signing 
oh yes i'd definitely have him but charlie taylor didn't want us so i don't want him 
make the call victor orta have them throw in charlie taylor 
i'd take cornet and collins from burnley charlie taylor burned his bridges 
i feel sorry for the fans however their senior management deserve to be relegated after the disgraceful way they got rid of sean dyche also can't say i'm devastated for charlie taylor 😂😂 
i want us to sign charlie taylor back i think he will be decent for us at lb 
charlie taylor back too or am i viewing him through football manager tinted glasses 
charlie taylor is really good though 
than charlie taylor yes dibyiu also remember him sticking 2 fingers up to leave us for burnley sack that he's gone leave him 
hopefully would love cornet from burnley or charlie taylor back 
charlie taylor not in a million years hope he rots in the championship that's where he belongs 
we'll have charlie taylor back now thanks 
charlie taylor too 
teemu pukki charlie taylor would probably take dwight mcneil too 
charlie self before side' taylor absolutely not 
charlie taylor easy pickings 
should we be interested in charlie taylor from burnley former academy player amp we need a new left back 
charlie taylor 👀 
bring charlie taylor back 
charlie taylor come back 
cheers charlie taylor should be on the shopping list and get alioski back would be a good start 
i was quietly confident i thought we would draw and burnley lose think of poor charlie taylor 
him and charlie taylor 
in charlie taylor morgan gibbs white jack clarke maxwell cornet sam byram out rodrigo firpo james llorente play more geldhardt cresswell drameh 
hopefully we can poach a few of their better players on the cheap charlie taylor back at super leeds would be an improvement on firpo 
i'd have charlie taylor back at leeds in a heartbeat 
nick pope max aarons james tarkowski and charlie taylor should be top priorities 
charlie taylor would be a decent signing nick pope and james tarkowski should be brought in too 
charlie taylor if our fans can forgive dan james then they can forgive him too 
and management forces its talent to use those platforms hard the aim is to win younger audience because the traditional media already has its following so you'll have both examples…jonas brothers taylor swift charlie puth kerry washington j lo etc use tiktok like crazy 
charlie taylor 💯 
start now nick pope bring him in take charlie taylor too then go on and sign more don't ever gamble with our club again but thank you 
nowhere near top 10 mate only the likes of charlie taylor lowton westwood could be staying with only rodriguez barnes and vydra as their current attacking options there is a clear lack of creativity in the team 
can i just throw in a name for a signing charlie taylor 
and maybe charlie taylor and sarr 
maybe he needs lessons from charlie taylor he falls over on every contact amp gets a free kick😡😡 
anything tbh honest i'd take a jansson og and a charlie taylor red card today 
charlie taylor is there with his dad 
thank you 🥰 i listen to selena taylor dua lipa ariana maroon5 anne marie some of charlie puth weeknd ik you're a weeknd fan😅 
i said charlie taylor scores 90 3 to send us down on goal difference haha most optimistic for me is a draw and burnley lose 
not interested unless main event charlie methvan is kicking about 
leeds win 3 0 charlie taylor last minute winner for burnley 🙃🙃 
sam smith dancing with a stranger another one mike posner i took a pill in ibiza seeb remix charlie puth we don't talk anymore taylor swift exile one ok rock good goodbye one ok rock last dance james arthur empty space vevo live bloc party so here we are 
we have bruno and joelinton they have jack cork and charlie taylor 😂 
we lose to a pontus goal and charlie taylor equalises to get burnley a point after chris wood is sent off early for newcastle that would be the leeds way for things to go 
nct 127 charlie puth twice taylor swift 
does marjorie taylor greene want to make it illegal for political candidates to say things to the press that are not true is that the law she wants to introduce do you want a list of all the thing donald trump told the press that were false 
camila alan walker sia chainsmokers sean camila charlie ahead of taylor this is ther weirdest list😭 
i will never forget being at one of the worst gigs of my life oasis in cork the gallagher brothers are always harping on about their irish roots came on the stage with union jack guitars no one a word liam was rabbiting on about between songs he was clearly drunk and then 
i cant explain why but jack cork is like the english matic to me 
why tf was jack cork the first player to come to my mind when the other day i was saying we should look at cornet if they get relegated 😭 
surely you don't want us to sign jack fucking cork or something 😭 
jack cork gave every ounce he had 
couldn't agree more now the likes of pope tarkowski ben mee jack cork and ashley barnes are all going to want out

ive asked sky bet to put this on bet on sky betting please burnley vs newcastle utd jack cork to be card josh brownhill to be card also lfc fc vs wolves lfc win amp btts no amp also lifc win amp under 3 5 goals leeds games eriksen 2 shots out the box leeds 3 cards as a triple 
can u put this bet on sky betting please burnley vs newcastle utd jack cork to be carded josh brownhill to be carded also lfc fc vs wolves lfc win amp btts no and also lifc win amp under 3 5 goals leeds games eriksen 2 shots out the box leeds 3 cards as a triple 👍 
🔶 burnley must match or better leeds result to stay up i think they'll sit amp play for the draw initially inviting pressure from asm amp guimaraes the midfield won't hesitate to make fouls to slow newcastle down jack cork to be carded 3 75 josh brownhill to be carded 3 4 
dwight mcneil would be a beautiful signing him at lwb would be crazyyy plus it's massive competition to chilly burnley relegated so he should be cheaper tielemans also available in the summer for 25m i'm quite 50 50 with him but he would be class mcneil would be great tho 
couldn't give a toss what he does for portugal when you are giving away last minute penalties against leeds and being run ragged by dwight mcneil for your club that is concerning for that club's fans mbappe doesn't play in the premier league so why should i care 
dwight mcneil would be a class signing burnley relegated so i think he'd be cheaper him at lwb would be beautiful and be a strong challenge for chilly youri tielemans also available in the summer for 25m i'm quite 50 50 wiv him tbh but mcneil we should be all over hed be class 
burnley relegated which means dwight mcneil is cheaper he would be crazyyy at lwb doubt we will get cucurella tbh but mcneil would be class and tielemans available for 25m would be a steal aswell tbh 
i like the idea of dwight mcneil

levi colwill lewis o'brien dwight mcneil josh brownhill billy gilmour 
imagine paying for dwight mcneil 😂😂 
dwight mcneil was decent this season weghorst

dwight mcneil 
maxwell cornetto dwight mcneil emmanuel dennis 
dwight mcneil josh brownhill ismailia sarr 
dwight mcneil 
how much for dwight mcneil

dwight mcneil please 
dwight mcneil mikel 
dwight mcneil in as right wingback 🙏 
where's dwight mcneil still not better than jacob murphy i see 
how about dwight mcneil breaking the record for most shots in a season without scoring 
dwight mcneil to chessy then 
ay bit of sympathy for your lot but bringing aaron lennon on in 2022 isn't really where the prem is at get a forward maybe like a gayle and make good use of the loan market get some grafters and i'm sure you'll go canny next year sixpointsoffthemackems 
we should not have to be relying on a 36 year old aaron lennon to set the tempo we've discussed it on here before but our midfield weaknesses have not been addressed over the last 3 4 years and it's now caught up with us 
don't worry aaron lennon is coming on 
spurs from the days of jermaine defoe and aaron lennon 
huh 😭😭nah i'm crying a wout weghorst comp has to be the biggest eye sore you've ever concocted 
wout weghorst just a shit ross stewart 
wout weghorst for 15 mil as backup st

odds please on wout weghorst to score 30 league goals in the 2022 23 season 
i'd take pope over wout weghorst 😭 would rather leeds went down for that sweet kalvin phillips relegation clause tbh 
a premier league without burnley does not feel like the premier league anyways we should raid them for wout weghorst and nathan collins 
warra third pl goal of the season for wout weghorst 
wout weghorst should've equalised there put it wide from three or four yards out nufc 
he pulled off wout weghorst 
wout weghorst will be the next mitrovic in the 22 23 championship 
wout weghorst and demarai gray🌚 
best we can do is wout weghorst and luuk de jong in terms of quality of signings 
jacob murphy 😂 
woodman matty longstaff and jacob murphy too i think 
jacob murphy absolutely loves it every single time🤣🤣🤣 what a team what a club 
where's dwight mcneil still not better than jacob murphy i see 
joelinton's being stretchered off the pitch jacob murphy will replace him nufc 
looks like jacob murphy's going to replace joelinton who's had a niggling groin problem this season newcastle's 2 350 fans are singing joelinton's name nufc 
watford a an absolute pub dog a sean longstaff screamer and a 90th minute jacob murphy howler… i was convinced that we simply weren't going to win a single game this season after this 🙃 
cook pini🙏🙏 better and more grateful than moussa sissoko and ddembele 
moussa sissoko when he heard the word bonus 
i think the only key is paying an insane comission to moussa sissoko that's all sport project couch who believes in you and fight for you against the whole world teammates who stand by you city you and your family love to live in fans you have won do not matter 
not a sad day for moussa sissoko though if dembele plays his last game for barca 
a side with this front four are rushing things like they've got ken sema upfront ever since the crowd let them know it was two nil they've shat the bed 😆 
kouyate replaces jesurun rak sakyi who receives a standing ovation from more or less every cpfc fan inside selhurst park 24 minutes remaining 
congratulations to jesurun rak sakyi on receiving his first ever start for crystal palace final game of the season let's finish strong 
premier league crystal palace vs manchester united substitution crystal palace 82' off 12 will hughes on 18 james mcarthur

yes that was james mcarthur as clay boy — danno and the son of helen hayes

scored the most goals for his team which is exactly what he is paid to do is singled out as the problem he is the presumably the reason sancho started a poorly why bruno fernandes keeps misplacing unnecessary passes 
so prior to conte at spurs you would choose davies sanchez bentancur over varane maguire amp bruno fernandes 😅😅 
ronaldo cavani greenwood i know what happened sancho bruno fernandes pogba varane rashford maguire shaw and de gea with van de beek on bench should be enough for top 4 
players involved in the most goals in all competitions in 2021 2022 🇵🇹 cristiano ronaldo 24 ⚽️ ✖️ 3 🅰️ 🇵🇹 bruno fernandes 9 ⚽️ ✖️ 14 🅰️ 🇫🇷 paul pogba 1 ⚽️ ✖️ 9 🅰️ 🇧🇷 fred 4 ⚽️ ✖️ 5 🅰️ 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 jadon sancho 5 ⚽️ ✖️ 3 🅰️ 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 mason greenwood 6 ⚽️ ✖️ 2 🅰️ 
6 bruno fernandes from being hailed as the king of portugal and old trafford he shrivelled into his she'll for the season when ronaldo arrived his diving moaning and crying have been exemplary this year 
would you not try and fit bruno fernandes in at 9 0m he's playing as a false 9 under eth and looking great in pre season on penalties now ronaldo has left too 
i'd rather have bruno fernandes in man utd team than pogba lingard dalot awb martial rashford mctominay telles yes he's had a poor season but everyone has bar degea and cr7 
luis diaz obviously this season and in the same league bruno fernandes before that and luis suarez much before that just to name a few sunderland got promoted and your head is gone dougie just a flurry of stupid tweets 
me i like you oo jawe you are not proud and accept defeat but you see that sunderland bruno fernandes called that was shouting he would finish above chelsea 🤭🤭 common arsenal use 11 points gap you 😅😅 
i know that player is bruno fernandes because he's too lazy 
and he's name was bruno magico finito fernandes 
they don't see beyond their worlds bruno fernandes is a world class creator it was ten hag that even asked them to renew his contract bruno thrives with off the ball movement that's why he worked well with cavani 
bruno fernandes 4 10 by far the worst positionally disciplined player in the squad if he does not sort this out eth will look quickly to replace new contract in the middle of the season abysmal glue him to the final 1 3'd please 
most important bruno fernandes he was the one that led to the goal 
bruno fernandes is here to stay 
bruno fernandes is better 
his very good another player whose done more in the game than bruno another player whose just a better footballer than bruno bruno is so so average 🤣how can anyone say they love football but rate bruno fernandes 🤣🤦 
bruno fernandes for me has been awful this season i don't think it was wise of united to boost his contract when there was no need to since he had enough years already i think the new contract and high wage will make him end up like aubameyang and ozil 
as a barca fan we need to send him to man united and get bruno fernandes in return 
goalkeeper of the season ederson defender of the season alexander arnold midfielder of the season kevin de bruyne striker of the season cr7 coach of the season pep flop of the season player bruno fernandes useless club of the season man utd 
bruno fernandes scores more than modric and creates more you're going to tell me that makes him a better overall player jude's role is the reason why he scores more or creates more he plays closer to the box he isn't faster nor is he a better dribbler he just attempts 
3 years of age telling grown men that she loves bruno fernandes against her will 
ten hag should sell rashford bruno fernandes fernandes play stupidly and still be throwing his arms around like wtf does that 
fred is a better player these season than bruno fernandes fernandes is beginning to pass me off useless player without the ball on his feet 
that 10 role fizzled out with ozil ain't no damn 10 anywhere anymore bruno fernandes is not a 10 argue it anyhow you want to take it anywhere go online to check you'll hear and see the same thing he's not a 10 for pogba he was useless in every role being deployed 
rangnick always throws ronaldo under the bus but wont even mention bruno fernandes being the shit head that does this every game 
bruno fernandes is never a good player his so arrogant and has nothing to offer he has never showed up in a big game even small game nothing to show up and he keep playing all the games this season please flush him out we don't need this evil players again 
mo salah and bruno fernandes hat trick on gw1 
selling bruno fernandes early in the season 
notice how fernandes dalot ronaldo and telles try to find each other as much as possible the 4 speak portuguese and since the return of dalot and telles we have gone thru troubles with organisation of the team look at today's gift from bruno left everyone to give to dalot 😔 
kdb lost possession 32 time vs aston villa nobody will talk about it because he is not bruno fernandes nonsense 
stick to telemundo this football thing is not for you if you think bruno is a world class player i agree with the players you mentioned but fernandes shouldn't be exempted 
bruno fernandes not good for manchester united i have been saying this mata should be the one starting for us this bruno never show in any big games since he came to manchester even small game he disappear why hand a new contract to him 
bruno moanalot fernandes is the main one been donkey pish all season and he gets a 3yr deal with extra 100k a week clubs full of delusion personnel that have zero knowledge of the game 
i don't know what the coach see in bruno fernandes bruno fernandes is the worst player this season and yet he played almost all the games 
let bruno fernandes go let him go juan mata is far far better than this useless bruno fernandes 
diaz our sterling jota our bruno fernandes front three wheels falling off frontline future looking finito 
when ten hag announces that bruno fernandes and de gea are leaving the club 
ten hag watching bruno fernandes

it was bruno fernandes just admit it 
wanted to follow you buh that bruno fernandes couzin vex me 🙄 
ourselves just say bruno fernandes mate 
bruno fernandes and maguire are the most useless players in the world 
20 bruno fernandes started the season with a hat trick and we all thought here we go he's gonna be on fire…sadly that's where it ended in the league anyway nothing like his usual self and only rare glimpses of brilliance but maybe his standards were to high 5 10 
sell bruno fernandes 
definitely definitely agree if you can make it that far there's definitely room for improvement unless you're bruno fernandes

bruno fernandes is not a good player anymore he's been poor throughout the season poor performances he bangs in a goal and the fans will be like he's the best midfielder in the premier league but honestly he's been shit all season he should be benched next season 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪 
to think some man united faithfuls are still asking for bruno fernandes to be made the captain of this club is atrocious and senseless i have said it before and i'll say it again bruno is just an ok player and nothing more don't have great expectations of him we need quality 
that boy bruno fernandes and his fellow brothers need to be sold asap if we ever wanna even dream of winning trophies 
that's while de bruyne is better all bruno fernandes has to do is keep his pass simple nothing more but as a typical modern manchester united player he just has to do some show off and here we are collecting wotowoto everywhere erik ten has lot of work to do goodluck to him 
and wtf happened with that upgrade there was like 5 6 days left that's why i did it had a lot of packs saved and not even a single laliga tots but also bruno fernandes tots and neuer tots both untradable repeated and with 0 recoveries left 
you shouldn't have offered a silly upgraded salary to bruno fernandes said ten hag 
i hate bruno fernandes 
nah to buy 12 players o all these players are useless including bruno fernandes he does whatever he likes 
you can take bruno fernandes 
and if you blame bruno fernandes for the problem dont watch united because look at our defense leaking goals but no one we don't blame to defend let's all blame on bruno and also he is not overrated and never was where have you got this overrated bruno from and bruno is a good 
bruno fernandes is crap he may have been good previously but he's definitely the most overrated player in the squad

we've just extended bruno's contract manchester united is delighted to announce that bruno fernandes has signed a new contract which will keep him at the club until june 2026 with the option to extend for a further year rewarding his inconsistency

bruno fernandes of manchester united no 18 
than the likes of bruno fernandes looks at table he's 5th 😂 
pl poty bruno fernandes is the bigger crime 
bruno fernandes has created most chances in the league and has the most assists in the champions league 
it was bruno fernandes 
y'all here pointing accusing fingers at bruno are just comedians is bruno fernandes the only player on the team united season has been disastrous and apart from bruno ronaldo and de gea everyone else in that team has been performing below par 
no he is not he has poverty stat too the 3 goals against norwich got people fooled he has been poor just like the rest he is the bruno fernandes of chelsea 
yet they gave bruno fernandes a new contract🤔 
bruno fernandes is the best guess 
🇪🇸🗣️ juan mata via bruno fernandes is football sick sometimes i tell him you're too heavy shut up ' with bruno i speak a lot about football he knows a lot of players he knows everything kind of like ander herrera was mufc 🔴 manutd 
bruno fernandes did 18 goals 12 assist last season but he wasn't the best player 
because hes arrogant cheats lashes out at other players and dives all the time cant stand him bruno fernandes is exactly the same before you say there is another reason 
and don't say well in some games he got to play up he didn't consistently and before bruno fernandes name a player that was capable of playing possession soccer in our midfield and attack none that's another example of poor we are run 
lol like who ronaldo or bruno fernandes far from behind 😂 
stopped trusting this award scheme after he won it the previous season over bruno fernandes 🤦 
these frauds will be saying bruno fernandes and salah are better players than xavi and iniesta because of goals and assist lmaoo 
bruno fernandes and jason sancho actually made a lot of key passes unfortunately didn't sign a world class finisher to finish chances when they need it the most they could only rely on inconsistent youngsters or washed players 
manchester united slumped to one last defeat in a sorry season by losing 1 0 to crystal palace and a slot in the europa league next season 
i love the passion well played hannibal mejbri you need to show that passion to 
5 10 i hope eth sells 98 of the idiotic first team get better young players with considerable wage demands on top of fully promoting breakthrough prospects to the 1st team namely hannibal mejbri 
correction we accidentally typed in '08' twice let's put that right substitution 62' manchester united off 46 hannibal mejbri on 08 juan mata 
the tunisians of the country hate him because he is in selection and that he is in a big club unlike their favorite players from the country a patriotic racism 😂😂 extremely happy for hannibal mejbri and to see that you all appreciate him unlike tunisians 🇹🇳✨ 
i know what his name is but nobody calls him mejbri it's hannibal 
mejbri is his last name his name is hannibal get informed who's the great hannibal barca 
wouldn't it be great if i had hannibal lectar not hannibal mejbri so he could disembowel these players because they are all gutless 
hannibal mejbri starts for man utd good chance of him getting a yellow today 
believe erik is already imprest no need of fada impression for hannibal mejbri

literally today on kasper schmeichel's instagram story 
kasper schmeichel hiding from the radar on his line every time the oppo had a corner 
heard a wee whisper late in the week that a deal to bring in kasper schmeichel is being worked on 🤷🏻‍♂️ 
only 1 of them are on the team anymore if you wanted all time city you've got sancho kasper schmeichel sturridge trippier brahim diaz angelino denayer iheanacho 
35 is the same age as cameron jerome who did a good job for luton or as kasper schmeichel but it's older than greg cunningham 
nampalys mendy isny good enough and maddison is out of position we lose so much in the midfield 
dwight mcneil would be a class signing burnley relegated so i think he'd be cheaper him at lwb would be beautiful and be a strong challenge for chilly youri tielemans also available in the summer for 25m i'm quite 50 50 wiv him tbh but mcneil we should be all over hed be class 
tielemans is definitely going all other key players will stay along with shifting the dead wood and adding to it the issue is we need to sell to buy so if a youri drags it ruins our window 
bvb aren't selling both jude and haaland i feel like our only signing this window might be youri tielemans 😂 
where is youri tielemans going now no champs league for arsenal 👀 
i am happy with your pursuit of houssem aouar as a replacement for youri tielemans but watch out for real betis sign him early 
get a contract extension in for him and ndidi before it becomes same situation as youri tielemans' 
6 jorginho odsonne edouard armando broja youri tielemans raul jimenez pablo fornals jacob ramsey rodrigo ademola lookman christian pulisic harvey barnes gabriel martinelli danny welbeck 
there's a star man he plays in blue and white his name is youri tielemans he's fucking dynamite 
that's literally just youri tielemans with suarez teeth 
a big thank you to youri tielemans wonderful footballer and professional i'll be sad to see you go 🤞but will be forever greatful for your facup goal don't go and sit on a bench somewhere you are better than that 
some real journalistic integrity 
alex mccarthy saintsfc kept the odd clean sheet then and again at the beginning of the season but sadly not premier league quality can't think of an outstanding game that he had this season he made good saves sometimes this season but need to move him on 4 10 
😂😂😂 u fool waaa 
few freebies we could look at seems as if too late for fraser forster amp sam johnstone but maybe ben foster or alex mccarthy 
goalkeepers won't leave alex mccarthy likely to leave willy caballero certain to leave fraser forster saintsfc 
does this mean alex mccarthy ranks outside the top 20 
kyle walker peters saintsfc my player of the season thanks spurs kwp rarely disappoints and has been ralph's best signing imo scored a great goal against man city and has been a bright spark within a pretty shite squad 1 of only 5 players who need to stay 9 10 
defenders won't leave jack stephens lyanco tino livramento romain perraud kyle walker peters unlikely to leave mohammed salisu likely to leave jan bednarek saintsfc

absolutely someone i used to call my best friend in highschool was falsely acused and she lost me as well as most of her friends when the guy came out and said he was lying so long had passed that our friendship never went back to the way it was 
so this friend told this story to the media how long ago what was the timestamp of the friend telling this story to the media 
yea a lot of ppl find him boring but hes rly cool he wants to be an author and is the only rly romantic one also the long hair is just amazinggg shane and sebastian do seem to be the favs tho 
interesting you should retweet such a thing so sexual predators support sexual predators right hence you amp amber hiring david shane despite the many women who mentioned his behavior long before the trial justiceforjohnny justiceforjohnnydepp amberheardlsanabuser amberturd 
thanks so much shane loved working with the squad you formed i'm in no rush but sure i won't be able to stay away long 
i think it unlikely to still hold any protective value after so long but not a scientist so that's a guess 
it didn't take that long i just fell asleep before i removed them 
shane long saintsfc he always gives his all and i love longy to bits will be sad to see him go but it is for the best as he is 35 now great servant but the time is right not been a terrible season and got us through against swansea and charges everything down 5 10 
week in week out he or cama will be sitting on bench and everyone will regret that signing for sure as casemiro is only 30 yo he will be here for a long time

xbox was a good brand for a long time but it was all downhill once people who cared about gaming like peter moore and shane kim left the company 
it still upsets me that we had a player as good as gabbiadini and we totally failed him… but we kept shane long because he runs

dude is clearly tryna shoot his way out of a month long slump and is failing miserably 
i would love this a lot more if tempe converted mill av into a walk only area turn the street into a massive walkable area and then the street car will fit it even then though if you cant walk from one end of mill to the other you are lazy the street is not long enough 
you've clearly thought long and hard about that decision shane do what's right for you when it is time plenty will miss you but don't let trying to protect others from grief make you go on longer than you're willing to 
amen to that shane and big kudos to you for hanging in and continuing the good fight long may you flourish 
the ones who gets depressed easily and feels down over little things won't last long either 
yes we have james milner 
love the certainty that liverpool would have scored like me saying that second yellow to james milner certainly would have been a city win 
aaronson spence johnson galan piroe and maybe the one and only james milner to take us to the next level 🤞🏻 
our james milner only better 
we love ya millie so much so we at olsc las vegas did this 👇……btw all proceeds go to our clubs charity 
james milner 
ha my dad who is 96 was watching the players parading at the end and he said why hasn't james milner got his wife and kids with him i don't know what he was getting at but i did say he is a bit older than the rest 
played your best player you just heard me say taa did not play right joel matip did not play as well james milner in mid field wow trying to prove a no point 
😅city are champions like it or now back at anfield liverpool should have been given a red card james milner the penalty for foden at the etihad fabinho n thiago should have seen red but they didn't n liverpool had many decisions made for them to benefit get the painbro 
arsenal fans are saying he's our james milner as per reliable option and laugh wants to kill me does he even have milner's quality i would pick milner above him 
james milner you are an age defying machine…never change 
taylor was a snake i'd sooner have sam byram back or james milner 
🤣🤣 i actually gave a copy of my first book to james milner to give to his kids i wonder if they ever read it 
2 minutes of james milner sideway passes with interstellar music in the background 😭 
he's our next james milner 😎 
you're pushing a half fit midfielder and and a half fit salah against them it's a recipe for disaster the squad strength claim is utter bollocks in the midfield they'll run the midfield again we're in big trouble no team of this size should be still using james milner 
yeah they are a very likeable side their most successful year for me was in 1999 or 2000 season when they reached the ucl semi final they played some wonderful football with great players like kewell viduka james milner yes darcourt smith rio l fell in love with lfc 
we moved gerrad on at 34 what's so special about james milner lol 
no you hiding behind james milner is 1000x worse touch a women 😂😂 
they're about to even give james milner a new contract lol 
people can only defend 60m generational midfielder naby keita by comparing him to 36 year old james milner 
james milner signs until 2025 
james milner is 37 btw 
james milner please 
mr reliable james milner and bobby firmino alisson for me he is the reason we were in race for the title lfc academy deserves a pat on their back for the talent we have the team with klopp to the special one jurgen klopp who has made us believers and we go again lfc 
thanks james milner 🥱 
so what if i told you we're extending james milner 
james milner as your profile pic 
james milner can play in 3 of those positions i wouldn't put it past us to go for him 
james milner would run 3 days for that jersey without a break he embodies what made us great i'd rather have 100 milners in the team than one more title 
james milner contract extension 
on doit pas oublier james milner 
that's how it should be 😂😂 who his favourite player our dog is named after james milner millie mo salah is probs my fave player 🥰 
is right la james milner clear 
if klopp could spend as much as pep he would have had 5 5 instead he has to play bloody james milner and matip 
they bring on gundogan when they need a goal we bring on james milner and they're still barely winning the league 😍 
even with james milner in midfield i fancy liverpool 😂 
oh yes james milner my double ass 
thiago will do jedi mind games on his replacement if it comes to that master will help the pupil or james milner still hope it's not a hamstring 
you seem like you cry about everything how is it bad to play james milner was he supposed to assist villa somehow 
james milner is really useless i would have preferred chris jones 
hell give it to dendoncker james milner milner 
imagine james milner scores for liverpool 
i'd rather play against 2 thiago's than one james milner 
premier league liverpool vs wolverhampton wanderers half time substitution liverpool off 06 thiago alcântara on 07 james milner 
or james milner counting on you to score four against ex norwich sieve john ruddy mate 
come on james milner get well soon alcantara 
would be hilarious if james milner did tho 
or james milner 😂😂 city's tears would taste sweet 
a james milner stunner to win the league 
you see the togetherness in the group when things haven't gone our way we keep fighting james milner is on for lfc vs wolves replacing thiago he spoke to about liverpool's trophy hunt dishing out fines amp klopp's big strength

james milner 
james milner 7️⃣ bought on a free transfer from city and has given everything he can for the badge just last week the performance he gave at wembley was something to admire and if he doesn't get the 1 year extension i hope he stays on as a coach liverpool's no 7 ❤ 
don't forget james milner 😭 
i thought james milner was in the running for it 
probably james milner mr reliable won the lot plays any position role model to the kids vice captain never involved in any sort of scandal on or off the pitch just fucking class 
you look like a cross between david batty and james milner in that pic rick 😂 
james milner 
erm james milner 
what do u expect james milner is british🇬🇧 whilst is african 
i get that however even with a new contract james milner has no reason to earn more than mane 
that list is a bit of a micky in places literally anyone who didn't play ucl in the 2000s but played in the pl putting in james milner almost isn't believable these days

yess we need player like ruben neves 
the easiest thing to do is to buy frenkie de jong konrad laimer ruben neves amp bring back james garner into the fold add bruno amp van de beek to that 4 then you have a good midfield 6 capable of doing things mcfred have to go asap 🚮 
forget phillips go and get ruben neves 
we need zubimendi instead of ruben neves 
basically sign him and ruben neves seems obvious 
as lovely as his namesake he's got great ears your cat not neves although i'm sure ruben's are nice too 😄 
ruben neves deserves a bigger club the guy is unreal 
in the absence of bernardo silvas volley my vote's going for ruben neves 
ruben neves for me sucker for a delicate chip 
i'm all in for ruben neves 100 
liverpool should go for like a ruben neves from wolves 
🔟 wolves • 51pts middle of the pack for wolves who can't seem to score many goals they have the 4th lowest goals scored this season but have found comfort in new boy jose sa as well as a few young talents they now face a battle to keep ruben neves at the club 
we need not only a striker… but also a reliable defensive midfielder like ruben neves … a versatile defender that can be used as lb or rb … 
won't get any of those players i'm saying ruben neves if xhaka leaves and that's it 
ruben neves 
2 0 down 3 2 up ruben neves wrapped it up 
fabrizio any news regarding ruben neves 
ruben neves 
ruben neves to tottenham 
de jong or ruben neves especially de jong surely one to watch 
neves hasn't really admitted it because he said was ruben neves has admitted he could have played his last wolves game if i go it would be really hard for me and my family this club means everything to me our careers are really short we need to take the opportunities we have 
we'll sign at least one cm even two if xhaka leaves lokonga needs to be sent out on loan tielemans ruben neves douglas luiz bissouma to join 
totally agree until told otherwise by official sources then we've got neves ruben neves wolveslegend 
they have brought respect back to their fans after the horrific ruben neves chant… 
you deadarse rate ruben fucking neves 💀 
looking forward to hearing that bruno was happy with cundle as a replacement for ruben neves 
get us ruben neves 
ruben neves 😭😭😭 good lord this organization is washed 
ruben neves brother you know good footballer how is nobody even considering him my god that guy is good 
raphina ruben neves 2 defenders one back left back we good 
buy gabriel jesus ✅ jonathan david ✅ ruben neves or renato sanches ✅ bring back william saliba ✅ 
and a final goodbye to ruben neves 😭 
who cares farewell ruben neves 
someone actually needs to check how many passes he even completed today because this man is as old as frenkie de jong ruben neves marcos llorente barella 
my ideal scenario would be villa beat citeh giving the scousers hope then ruben neves pops up with a last minute thunderbolt giving the title to the sheik squad and revenge for 04 05 76 finally 
ruben neves 
ruben neves looking like 
and for the last time ruben neves appears in our starting lineup thank you ruben ❤️😘🐺 
neves last day thank you ruben 🧡 
we are stupidly chasing after phillips and rice there's konrad laimer kamara paulinha ruben neves 
de jong is xavis boy move on ruben neves please 
i used to call ruben neves 'gnasher' lol the past now alas 
they should use it to sign gabriel jesus and ruben neves 
yeah i'm working on that getting bruno amp ronaldo next maybe ruben neves once he gets a boosted special 
bissouma boubacar kamara ndidi idrissa gueye ruben neves casemiro would be my choice if rice isn't gettable 
how many manutd for don report for doing asko nico gaitan joao mourinho ruben neves erling haaland sergio ramos ezeqiel garay madrid is just pained anyhow on this mbappe matter 😂😂😂 
what odds on a ruben neves goal anytime from outside the box got to say goodbye in style wwfc livwol 
guys we got news ruben neves scored in the 99th minute 
hello wolfies here's bully

erm john mcginn 
let me guess should be a shortlist of stuart armstrong john mcginn andy robertson kenny mclean david weir archie gemmill and susan boyle 
sickening john mcginn never done anything to change the outcome of the league but you have to ask where paul pogba was for all this

john mcginn midfielder aston villa 35 appearences 3 goals 4 assists 1 78m 5'10 mcginn is a versatile midfielder playing in various positions this campaign as we have a lot of midfielders leaving the club this window he would be able to help fill in the roles we need

harry kane to score john mcginn to be booked

willian douglas costa diego costa taison david luiz daniel alves godin 
i know that feeling douglas luiz got 11 for me a couple weeks back and he was on my bench ffs 
who douglas luiz 
douglas luiz 
i agree his flexibility is definitely a strength of his game he's still young 22 also however i don't think he's a signing that i would get overly gassed about douglas luiz is better than him on the ball and i feel without him villa's midfield lacks a dictator 
not sure if u watch villa mate but keeping luiz and selling mcginn is one of the most stupidest things i've heard as a villa fan mcginn is one of our most consistent players whereas douglas luiz playes 3 good matches then has 5 bad ones 
is that douglas luiz who doesn't even try to tackle him smh 
douglas luiz for one lazy… 
douglas luiz waste of space 
douglas luiz mark 2 🤣 
we'll sign at least one cm even two if xhaka leaves lokonga needs to be sent out on loan tielemans ruben neves douglas luiz bissouma to join 
i hear in a number of places that we may add douglas luiz danny ings and tyrone to that outgoing list which would suggest a rather major overhaul even if only one of the three above does go 
nah i'd just bully mings cuz he's a clown and him and douglas luiz were at fault for the third goal let's be real 
douglas luiz should have dealt with that pass from mings 
so intercepts the pass douglas luiz doesnt read it kdb slides the ball to the back post and that mings fault mmm kay 
douglas luiz 🔦👀 
to be fair man city are just a class above i had the same thought about douglas luiz getting out of position 
konsa hopefully he goes back to his normal self fuck knows douglas luiz jonathan david would be nice 
douglas luiz inside job look at how he reacts after mings blocks the cross for one of the goals 
man city legend douglas luiz😍 
that's a picture of douglas luiz… 
that's douglas luiz a villa player lol 
agent douglas luiz stands still 
douglas luiz 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 
douglas luiz stands still 😐 
time for douglas luiz to find a new home that was pathetic lazy bs 
i hope douglas luiz got a prime from city because if he did that for free 🤣🤣 
the defending is so abysmal douglas luiz just stands and watches 
all this pain could be easily washed away by a strong window… my choice jesus sinisterra bissouma sangare douglas luiz hickey and keep saliba 
douglas luiz roma here we go 
let's hope they get douglas luiz from aston villa 
maybe douglas luiz could do a barton haha 
douglas luiz will be on market i guess 
douglas luiz on the move 
then it shows douglas luiz is leaving 
douglas luiz 
all good they can send douglas luiz over😂 
douglas luiz bet the press with the dribble brilliant play 
douglas luiz having a shocker 
same role as douglas luiz my friend 
douglas luiz to roma 
douglas luiz to roma confirmed 
gonna be lucas douglas luiz 
douglas luiz will be leaving so we need another midfielder 
ah fair i think villa would probably be a good step for him if that works out certainly an upgrade on douglas luiz in many ways and he'd be able to go about improving and developing aspects of his game without the big club spotlight' focussing on him 
wouldn't mind douglas luiz from villa if he's surplus to requirements as a result of kamara's signing an all brazilian nufc midfield 😅🇧🇷 
dont think its an awful move but they rarely dominate possession so not sure how well he will rack up possession points look at douglas luiz presumably replaced for instance 
they have douglas luiz man wtf 
🥅 de bruyne score or assist 📒 douglas luiz to be carded 
come on villa come on douglas luiz 
pipedown osman we are incompetent we don't go for this players we go for douglas luiz 🍻 
you need a douglas luiz all timer performance 
douglas luiz is gone then right 
douglas luiz is a former city player he would gift them this game 
aston villa olsen cash chambers mings digne mcginn douglas luiz ramsey buendía philippe coutinho watkins 
safe passer and relatively good defender they've basically signed douglas luiz twice lol 
just for mikel to sign douglas luiz for 40m 😭 
b kamara is a steal 💯 does that mean douglas luiz might possibly be on his way out would be interesting to see how this unfolds 
i can see us going for douglas luiz 
douglas luiz amp mc ramsey on the transition 
they already have douglas luiz 
douglas luiz replacement 
son to score douglas luiz booked 
⚽️ son to score anytime 🔶 douglas luiz to be carded 
de bruyne score or assist douglas luiz carded 
🤣 this just in the villa team coach pulled up near the etihad but was seen doing donuts in the carpark douglas luiz was atop singing cliff richard 
if you didn't know i liked it because douglas luiz is on it ex city player mate 
firpo and douglas luiz cards son to score two or more trent to assist 
xhaka and douglas luiz card son 2 or more goals mount assist 
fine team but for me i would have buendia in place of douglas luiz utv 
he aint gunna turn down playing with marcos llorente and koke in the champions league to play with mid table fodder shit like mcginn and douglas luiz 😂 
de bruyne to score and douglas luiz to be carded 
odegaard for douglas luiz 
douglas luiz will do a iheanacho and miss on purpose 
as long as the midfield isn't mcginn douglas luiz ramsey then i don't mind who else starts 
villa to ruin the party douglas luiz to score in first half 
douglas luiz would appear to be well hydrated here 🤣 
absagoalrush absaassist first assist emiliano buendia fulltime score 2 2 draw 
love mcginn and think he will excell with kamara sat behind but ollie really isnt a clinical finisher needs to many chances should have scored a few against city aswell suarez coming in would defo improve watkins imo but we would have to many strikers then 
ollie watkins aswell £50 mil to west ham and i'd give that archer a go in his place 
ollie watkins will never be a 9 that keeps us in the league key player i'm not buying into unless he moves out wide 
peter this is the worst thing i have seen today and i watched ollie watkins miss an easy one on one to put villa 2 0 up 
tav is better than cash bassey is better than mings aribo is better mcginn alfredo morelos is better than ollie watkins 
watkins needs service he will convert 1 in 4 chances that's mid table level the rest of the team don't contribute enough if ollie is expected to chase down lost causes we create a decent amount of chances we miss too many of them 
if only ollie watkins could finish or have a better touch 🤦🏻‍♂️ 
ollie watkins was crap today as well 
ollie watkins has missed big chances against them too he's got go to asap 
ollie watkins onside too 
you must be happy as a fan damn you ollie watkins lol 
spot on sick amp tired of same complaints week in week out ollie watkins has been v poor this season imo 2x 1 on 1s today woeful with both just can't afford to be so profligate city could should have had 6 or more today gerrard has to sort it out asap turn it around 
ollie watkins ruined our day 
ollie watkins hates us man 
ollie watkins come on man thanks you villa and gerrard you gave it one hell of a ride 
the ollie vs jack shootout ollie basically misses every one he's a hard worker thinks he can get 20 goals next season i just don't see it if you said 50m for mcginn 50m watkins 15m 35m for targett amp mings i'd take that 150m although i only see targett leaving 
ollie watkins play non shots on goal 
more mad at ollie watkins 
yeah we know we are shyte no need to remind us you guys let haaland go to city because you guys were so sure mbappe is in the bag but now he's gone you guys have lost your heads you should settle for someone like ollie watkins 😂 
i used to be a fan of ollie watkins not anymore bottled it twice 😩 
hes shit 😂😂 he couldn't finish a toilet roll i've never seen anybody miss as many one on ones as ollie watkins 
ollie watkins did 
yes the softness is ollie watkins 
if tyrone mings and ollie watkins start our first game next season then it'll be the same old same old both not good enough for the pl 
agreed i like mings konsa watkins i hope they stay at the club but the bench will be their most likely position in august no room for sentiment in the pl ollie's chances would've been put away by a natural cf kamara's a superb cdm coutinho today was different gravy 
the tactics villa played made me doubt city winning the game from 0 2 down villa could be out of sight if ollie watkins was effective amp their 2 layers of defence weren't stretched so i didn't see it coming i was only hoping wolves don't lose to liverpool 
this gave me hope ollie watkins cost us the title with his brexit finishing 
ollie watkins could get in behind here 
me watching antonio and ollie watkins chase their first touch for 90 mins against panathanaikos u21s 
it be ollie watkins that guy be useless pass😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 
no because you're chatting bollocks🤣 ollie watkins is a quality player he's 26 coming into his prime and scores goal he might miss a few chances but he'll come good next season chatting about never seeing him in a villa shirt again is stupid 🤣 
ashley what has happened to ollie watkins his head just exploded today 
don't get me started on this brother 😭😭😭 he's got the confidence of ronaldo but the ability of ollie watkins 
when he saw gerrard and ollie watkins going down the tunnel 😂😂😂😂 
i have to give gerrard amp beale massive props because that game plan worked perfectly ollie watkins head exploded amp that lack of quality in key areas against city showed but if anyone doubts phillipe coutinho just watch his goal 
no robby that's dumb coaching 2 0 up with 14 left shambles … and ollie watkins is the dumbest striker the league has ever seen 
when u r 2 0 down at 70 75 mins 3 goals in 5 to 6 minutes is pure luck wish ollie watkins had not missed that easy chance 
i'll invite martin olsen and ollie watkins instead 
ollie watkins deserves a 100 lashings 
game management unless it man city then its clever also did you know that you can be offside from your own half if you are ollie watkins 
if they could figure out the exchange rate for league one to epl they'd be way ahead of everyone else it's not like ollie watkins and ivan toney needed testing in the championship they could have made the jump 
then ollie watkins showed up 
ollie watkins bottled like 50 chances 
ollie watkins 🙈 how's he playing in the premier league 
ollie watkins played the entire game at half speed 
oh yea and ollie watkins piss of he is just a flop in front of the goal 3 or 2 big chances and he fully missed it shame on you ofc i m not saying that aston villa is fully guilty but bro how can u lose like this man 
he was shocking throughout ollie watkins was fouled all over the park and didn't get a single call 
ollie fucking watkins 
ollie watkins needs to be offloaded asap a proper pl striker given the chances he's had this season would have 25 goals and a hat trick today and as for the the st mings we will have another average season with him 
ollie watkins is usless how has he missed two one on ones 
i blame ollie watkins 😂 man should have had a hat trick 🤦‍♀️ 
ollie watkins… leave my club 
ollie watkins playing like a sunday league player changed our game 
did the same in the first half played ten seconds under the four minutes added on to avoid booking ollie watkins 
we should have been 4 0 up but ollie watkins fluffed 2 simple chances then slippy himself makes a poor decision regarding the substitution and the rest is history 
i'll say it again then blame ollie watkins for liverpool losing 
ollie watkins should do something other than football or play in another league because you have to be bad at football to miss those goals 
up 2 0 and then drop 3 goals in 5 minutes and ollie watkins missed a wide open chance ffs 
dont forget blatent red card on fernandinho for tackle on ollie watkins they didnt even get a free kick 
ollie watkins really does own liverpool 4 goals agaisnt them and denied them the title 
can't blame him when his main striker ollie watkins did and inside hob for city he had 2 1v1 and missed both 
i'm sure ollie watkins is gutted 
villa showed a lot of heart today but ollie watkins has to be the worst striker in the premier league he should have had a brace amp his head just exploded 
ollie watkins is useless 
classic villa throwing away victory from the jaws of victory never want to see ollie watkins wear that shirt again 
get ollie watkins out of this club every fucking week 
stevie g gonna be lying in a street gutter rambling about ollie watkins not being able to score one on one's tonight 
ollie watkins 
yep me see it with ollie watkins 
how much did you guys pay ollie watkins he had 2 1v1 and missed both this game could have been over by now 
it's been very good shame ollie watkins is playing 
i could fault doug luiz totally asleep i could ollie watkins totally wasting opportunities they really won't be able to complain when upgrades come in 
we scored but ollie watkins bottled 
what the actual fuck ollie watkins has been up there on his own against the champions his job isn't just to score this isn't fifa on amateur level 
ollie watkins is not that good 
ollie watkins one minute 
if only ollie watkins could finish 
ollie watkins is fucken atrocious however ahaha 
ollie useless watkins is possibly the worst striker in the prem after this game 
ollie watkins should've had a hat trick city on a knife edge 
luckily for city ollie watkins is playing 
ollie watkins is terrible 
city will win cus ollie watkins isnt converting he's having a shocker 
ollie watkins in squad 🥺 
i first think say na ollie watkins 
ollie watkins is awful 
not sure why pep thought playing against ollie watkins was a good send off for him 😅 
ollie 5 touch watkins 😅 his chance in first half too 🤦🏻‍♂️ game should be out of sight 
ollie watkins has blood on his hands 
ollie watkins clean through but pulls it wide 
no not no more bro ollie watkins is shitting the bed😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 
they've caught city panicked a few times ollie watkins is active but not made much of what he's had 🤣 fernandinho looks exposed if he stays on city don't win 
legend ollie watkins giving man city trouble today love to see it 
ollie watkins is not a pl striker i don't care how much he runs or works i want my 33m striker hitting the net the chances he's had this season he should have 25 goals by now not good enough 
i don't support liverpool but how the hell was fernandinho not sent off for pulling ollie watkins back as last man 
i don't support liverpool but how the hell was fernandinho not sent off for pulling ollie watkins back as last man 
ollie watkins masterclass incoming 
ollie watkins 
ollie watkins gonna put him in his retirement home 
ferna at cb against ollie watkins and danny ings bro 
love the guy but ferna vs ollie watkins sounds like recipe for disaster 
79' ollie watkins man city 1 1 villa 
if we're gonna use one off games then i could flip it and say i've seen him get roasted by ollie watkins for 90 min i've not been influenced i've used my eyes and he isn't good enough 
ollie watkins with an assist manchester city 3 aston villa 2 
i've gotta feeling ollie watkins will bag 
score assist ollie watkins to be carded tyrone mings 
ollie watkins 
they have done their bit now onto the next chapter would take schick for laca ollie watkins for nketiah and bissouma for elneny 
city aren't the type to bottle it but if they defend like they did against west ham i can see ollie watkins causing some damage if walker and stones are fit could be different story originally i thought you'd beat burnley but at turf moor i think they'll get at least a point 
yourodds danny ings amp ollie watkins over 1 shot on target combined 
unbiased opinion ollie watkins gt gt current pessi 
i'd rather have it 0 0 at etihad then 93 ollie watkins wins game for villa and number 20 for reds 👍👍👍 
any of our players could you join city you contribute an odd goal an odd assist and then you get a photo with a cup literally marvelous nakamba could do that it's not hard but also not particularly rewarding unless you significantly contribute 👍🏼 
yes but bloody marvelous nakamba could walk into your team play for 5 mins and win a medal it's not exactly a flex it's not special unless you played a part in winning the title🥰😍😘 
in what universe is marvelous nakamba a better option than coutinho 
brings on a defensive midfielder called marvelous nakamba who was anything but 
for marvelous nakamba wouldn't get a game for blackbrook 
brought marvelous fucking nakamba on the idiot 
who tf names their kid marvelous nakamba 
unfortunately marvelous nakamba is playing so we're not getting anything 
us zimbabweans weren't happy with this move marvelous nakamba😭 
are you a brother to marvelous nakamba mr makamba and are you trying to tell us somethin is the match fixed already i hope your brother won't do anything to jeopardize liverpools chances 
who's even hating on danny ings like that man 
shesaidno7 barber to barber mythfielder are up there and i've only seen it used once but fanny stings for danny ings had me in tears😭 
mate honestly at this rate i'd settle with someone like danny ings 😭😭 
i don't think he rates danny ings 
i quite liked the overhead from danny ings not as good as andy carroll's though 
danny ings 
danny ings gets this 
danny ings is the best 
danny ings 😭😭😭 
if we signed danny ings to play centre half instead of romero we probably wouldn't have finished top four either 
we've just finished 15th the same as last season but without danny ings i wouldn't call that backwards and if it is it's certainly not his fault 
i'm surprised ings hasn't started more over ollie imo danny is much better offensively and is more of a natural goal scorer 
him and danny ings could of bagged us so many more points 
when fans don't realise the board are trading down that puts pressure on the manager we're 15th again having replaced danny ings with a championship striker and an on loan teenager why would you expect better saintsfc 
he's only really lost coutinho and has got £15m for non first team players like solanke danny ings and danny ward also the super cup and club world cup are glorified friendlies on the same level as celebrating a community shield 
i mean obviously the villa players won't be bothered they didn't win it for liverpool minus coutinhio and possibly danny ings 
i hear in a number of places that we may add douglas luiz danny ings and tyrone to that outgoing list which would suggest a rather major overhaul even if only one of the three above does go 
he delayed danny ings sub 
aye spot on bar i don't think weghourst is good enough i think we need a pacey striker with jay or maybe with weg but we deffo need that andre gray' danny ings' type striker 
you lick fat nobs and you're getting relegated you brazilian danny ings ego of ronaldo but the ability of oli watkins 
knowing levy we will end up with danny ings welbeck and lamptey 
nothing special put danny ings in and he will win it too 
throwing on danny ings he knew what he was doing 
yeah villa braught danny ings on liverpool fans erupted thinking they scored 😂 
danny ings to score next 
danny ings is on though maybe 🤞 
danny ings equaliser 
nah danny ings to score in 95 for liverpool to grab it 😭 
was watching liverpool game its ok fucking danny ings anyone will score idc 
danny ings 🙏🏻 
tyrone mings assisted on danny ings first goal and it was very fun 
danny ings 
why do i have feeling danny ings go fokop 
danny ings 
come on danny ings we need you ynwa 
danny ings maybe 
danny ings i beg 
danny ings pls 
ffs then ig danny ings 
na that danny ings guyyy dae vex me agberooo

it's all fixed bro that performance by danny ings against convinced me that those up top want it to happen i bet liverpool will win the league tonight 
want danny ings or leon bailey in a situation like that no faffing no self doubt 
i knew it was all fixed when i saw that danny ings performance against liverpool 
hope you have a nice day and danny ings scores 4 goals 
coutinho squares the ball to danny ings can you believe it 
coutinho to danny ings and goaal city 10 1 aston villa 
haha or danny ings 
😂i see a danny ings equilizer from a coutinho cross to send the trophy down merseyside 
he has some liverpool connections in his team courtinio and danny ings

danny ings will turn into prime sergio aguero ynwa 
where is sir danny ings 
without forgetting danny ings😅😅😅 
come on you redmen danny ings to get the equaliser this is our year 
need that danny ings hat trick today 😭😭😭😭 
danny ings coming off the bench 
and it's danny ings… oh he's missed what a chance to level it for villa and what a chance for danny ings to win the title for his former club ' 
i think you need to drop the liverpool football club bit by bit today dropping the club just as danny ings rounds off his hattrick 
ferna at cb against ollie watkins and danny ings bro 
danny ings looks fucked in the middle 
dream scenario 1 0 to city in injury time ball goes in touch gérard throws it to coutino who throws to danny ings shoots hits post comes out hits stirling and goes in 1 1 whistle blows 
danny ings coutinhooooo 
danny ings 96th minute winner for villa we win 3 0 
danny ings to seal a 2 2 draw in the 94th min to hand the title ❤️ 
personally i think danny ings's will be better 
when man city lose to danny fucking ings 
anytime goalscorer danny ings 
watch him score a 86th minute equaliser to win the league for liverpool 🙄 danny ings with the assist 👀 
danny ings hat trick 👀

danny ings will do the magic

danny ings recreating this 
lots of factors to blame this season some bielsa squad size some individual but mostly recruitment hypothetical question if we'd signed gallagher and say danny ings somebody who was available … would we still be talking about bielsa burn out 
🦸‍♂️ liverpool old boys to the rescue we're 50 1 for danny ings to score a goal assisted by coutinho and lfc win the premierleague title mciavl livwol 
danny ings to score 😍 
there is danny ings steven gerrard and philippe coutinho the only saviors to win the epl 
everything is crossed today up the villa danny ings getting a late equaliser just don't let it be a late city winner i'd rather them run away with it early 
danny ings winner again city 
danny ings 
philippe coutinho danny ings steven gerrard to name few 🤔

going off of the way danny ings joined this could be announced tomorrow for all we know 
danny ings 
another one i just thought of finishing in the same position as last season without the goals of danny ings losing him added to my doubts of saints surviving but they've gone through the season without having many major scares 
danny ings for first assist 
i had a dream zack steffen started and danny ings smashed in a 20yard screamer in 91st minute to earn a 1 1 draw

arsenal should do that aswell and pay £15m for tim krul 
tim krul too 
tim krul in goal 
4 1 win incoming both teams have been incredible this season but city won't lose a big game like this at home it will be more like brighton than qpr 😂 i fully expect a tim krul masterclass at norwich 
thats right it's going to be tim krul

taylor was a snake i'd sooner have sam byram back or james milner 
because we are lining up in a premier league with sam byram at cb utter disgrace 
in charlie taylor morgan gibbs white jack clarke maxwell cornet sam byram out rodrigo firpo james llorente play more geldhardt cresswell drameh 
smith says sam byram's hip locked up which is why he was substituted in the first half ncfc nortot 
norwich substitution zimmermann gt byram sam heads straight down the tunnel so assuming that's an injury but we will see ⏱️37 🔰 0 2 🤒 ncfc nortot thfc 
sam byram number 3 😭😭😭 
you'll be fine mate don't worry we're playing sam byram at cb sonny and kane are having a field day 
find out why grant hanley voted ncfc ambassadors player of the year did not come to the room after the game to pick up his trophy despite a room full of loyal supporters awaiting him he was playing football with his daughter in the centre circle very sad and disappointing 
they really spammed pukkis instagram should have been sending grant hanley some defending advice 
grant hanley and sam bryan at cb if you don't score 5… 
son anytime goal scorer grant hanley to be booked 
of the biggest 😂😂 ronaldo only come back coz of his history with the club i would genuinely rather have grant hanley that varane and sancho a big name 🤣🤣🤣🤣 he scored a couple goals in the german league and u bought him for 80m also a city reject 👍 
i'm feeling a grant hanley masterclass 
heard we are in for grant hanley as goldsons replacement 
mathias normann 🇳🇴 25 midfielder a tidy midfielder on loan at norwich could be a good romeu replacement 
milot rashica 🙃 
they can do a swap for milot rashica imo 
milot rashica legacy matchhhh 
sorry atl but today milot rashica is going to show us all why he's worth 10 million quid…

teemu pukki has more pl goals this season than jesus 
did you cry when teemu pukki didn't score 
teemu pukki might be available arteta was raving about him all last week and how he was going to get you in the ucl 
big ego from a guy with less premier league goals than teemu pukki 😂😂 
our pathetic fanbase are now scrambling around looking for new profile pictures after putting up pictures of norwich city and teemu pukki shambles 
teemu pukki charlie taylor would probably take dwight mcneil too 
teemu pukki scored more goals than you 😂😂😂😂😂😂 embarrassing 
imagine giving it large when your team finished 16th and you scored less than teemu pukki 🤦🏻 
fair play he's bought right into that everton mentality 😂 less goals than teemu pukki hahahahaha 
ur a disgrace hope u get relegated to league 1 fuck teemu pukki fsgout 
yeah that teemu pukki would do a job for us… oh wait 🫣

keita is a senagelese extra spice harry winks 
harry winks 3 5 
harry winks many don't like him but his role is specific and he's very good at it in charge of recycling the ball and keeping possession while being a busy bee running around to put pressure on opposing midfielders such a tidy player and proper coys rating 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 
harry winks takes the spotlight 😍 
harry winks sitting in the corner knowing he wont be any part of it love him but he knows 
6 8 players must be signed 2 full backs 2 central defenders 2 midfielders 2 strikers pape sarr bryan gill giovani lo celso harry winks and tanguy ndombele 
harry winks 6 he was alright played a bit under conte and looked pretty reborn particularly in the creative end where he's done good then the purple patch was over and we kinda got normal winks back but he still made a positive difference 
harry winks 1 10 leave my club 
hope its farewell appearance for harry winks 
he's gonna look great next to harry winks next season 😩 
you're broke you can have harry winks 
harry winks is available 
harry kane starts spurs xi lloris sanchez dier davies emerson hojbjerg bentancur sessegnon kulusevski son kane subs gollini winks rodon bergwijn lucas white scarlett devine craig live live nortot arseve 
two things i am hoping 1 an early spurs goal to ease our nerves and 2 the last time i ever see harry winks on a spurs team sheet 
i actually do ffs xhaka is not a bad midfielder elneny is by no means elite but he's a decent squad player and does a job when called upon clear of harry winks 
harry winks 
harry winks 
harry winks in that 18 19 season was incredible especially in the champions league run with sissoko in the midfield 
harry winks 
harry winks would be amazing 
they can have harry winks 
they qualified and varane and pogba and fernandes didn't does this mean they are better than them too harry winks will qualify is spurs get a point today does that make him better stupid tweet 
harry winks and lucas moura 
harry winks has to be the next best option 
the biggest issue is marc andré ter stegen his not able to make any saves past 3 years he should be replaced asap 
pierre emerick aubameyang 🔥 appearances 14 goals 4 assists 1 goals per match 0 3 minutes per goal 260 shots 35 shots on target 18 shooting accuracy 72 goals with right foot 1 goals with left foot 3 goals from inside the box 4 1 2 
the amount of fans that cry about money and how much we spend on a certain player and his wages the amount that they cry about william saliba matteo guendouzi pierre emerick aubameyang alexandre lacazette look for every excuse in the dictionary😂 
all football players for barcelona left memphis depay right samuel umtiti ousmane dembele clement llenglet pierre emerick aubameyang 👌🏻 
emerick aubameyang has retired from international football after 13 years of representing the panthers of gabon ➡️the 32 year old before his resignation had appear 72 times and scored 30 goals for the senior national 
pierre emerick aubameyang and alphonso davies as well as axel meye and mario lemina have revealed that they have been diagnosed with heart issues following bouts of covid that could now affect their future participation in the sport 
on january 14 it was announced that arsenal's forward pierre emerick aubameyang had to withdraw ahead of his gabon side's match against ghana in the africa cup of nations later that day after a series of scans showed that he had lesions on his heart 
xavi has no tactical knowledge of the game why because he's not playing the greatest midfielder in the clubs history riqui puig the team needed a quick fix to achieve our aims we have see you next season with the insane lewa 
honestly it hasn't all been pure fanboy exaggeration riqui puig really had been bringing midfield play to our game but xavi is not the man 
e go shock them xavi's favouritism will be the end of him if koeman and xavi started riqui puig by now they'll be reaping the fruit of their labour because he would have grown like pedri instead xavi has decided to continuously play ferran lmao i see how game time improved 1 2 
he's the biggest shit ever same as riqui puig 
the way then attorney general robert kenedy convened a get hoffer squad is the way chelsea should convene a get riqui puig squad a brilliant player out of favor out of contract and out of the squad barcelona for next season i dont want anymore mm left sided quick passes 
riqui puig and mingueza both can be a part of the deal as leeds wanted them it will reduce 15 20 million of the total price but it seems difficult 
yea we still have sergi roberto umtiti braithwaite pjanic lenglet riqui puig mingueza balde for some reason 
🚨🚨🌕 there is a real possibility that granada sign both alex collado and riqui puig this summer it's granada president's dream fcblive

having all the money in world and signing riqui puig certainly a bizzare decision 
🚨🚨🌕 there is a real possibility that granada sign both alex collado and riqui puig this summer it's granada president's dream rmalive 
barça are already preparing the official statement for roberto's contract extension until june 2023 it will be announced next week it's already completed with the spanish fullback 🇪🇸🤝 fcb riqui puig braithwaite mingueza and umtiti will leave barça this summer 
🚨🚨🌕 there is a real possibility that granada sign both alex collado and riqui puig this summer it's granada president's dream rmalive 
my friend how've you been 🙂 any news on riqui puig these past days 🙏 
riqui doesn't get time to play with younger players coming in and finally getting sold this summer but that lack of playtime might be because of barca's former coach ronald koeman who doesn't like him because he want to sell puig to buy another player 
liverpool f c please go after barcelona's riqui puig before the season ends please he's being announced to depart barcelona this summer 
liverpool should try and go after riqui puig 
riqui puig is there too🔥😒 next iniesta 
riqui puig shouldn't be included in this list he needs more playing time and we've all seen he's a young talent 
riqui goes and roberto renews atleast loan out puig 
riqui puig to united let's go 
poor riqui puig i wish you the very best 
riqui puig would be a good option if we get him on a low fee 
please sign riqui puig he is one of the talented kids a he is out of contract at barça 
sergio roberto renews and riqui puig leaves i think sergio roberto is having nudes photos of the administration in barcelona 😂😂😂😂 
riqui puig 22 and oscar mingueza 23 are set to leave barcelona this summer according to and bbc sport paper talk both want game time thoughts 
memphis depay 
your guys are actually comparing benzema to depay in terms of dripping ahh is i mismatch for memphis 
kunzima lapha mbali even memphis depay is available for purchase they need to trim their wage bill 
the only thing depay tops is the drip or drown category nothing more 
really this is barca depay must know met gala fashion show is in another place 
maybe gnabry in a swap deal with depay i mean when we get lewa we dont need memphis 
memphis depay 
let's keep memphis depay if we can't afford raphinha now 
mingueza dest ferran torres frankie luck ter stegen i memphis depay 
john cena memphis depay and speed 
chelsea my favourate club plz go for memphis depay barcelona are attentive to arriving offers😶😶😶 
all football players for barcelona left memphis depay right samuel umtiti ousmane dembele clement llenglet pierre emerick aubameyang 👌🏻 
memphis depay 
memphis depay😃 
memphis depay 
don jorge molina 
jorge molina and vital penalties getafe vs inter granada vs espanyol what an unfortunate guy 
just like joao pedro jorge molina doesn't deserve this 
they deserve what was that penalty by jorge molina 
there's absolute jubilation in vitoria and pamplona as mallorca and cadiz both win but despair for granada who were firm favourites to stay up you have to feel for jorge molina who missed a penalty and another good chance at the death they even hit the post in stoppage time 
heard there is no eng translation yet just a few chapter here and there done by wu lei fans some also said novel is very tough to read like shakespeare terminology used are difficult to translate 
depends on what kind of books you like but the best ones i've read in recent times history anarchy by william dalrymple fiction shantaram by gregory david roberts classic 100 years of solitude by gabriel garcia marquez 
geez david when do you rest 
when everyone said stones otamendi garcia rodri zinchenko amp mendy we're shit when fernandinho was at cb can't have it both ways 
david schrader here baby badass rafael garcia henchman nightmare theater we only have 3 days left of the cannibals on mars campaign check it out if if sexy interstellar sci if horror is your thing 💫

ala verg david silva drunk flow 
canelo was literally about 40 0 when he fought mayweather ryan garcia is 23 devin haney is 23 shakur stevenson is 24 david benavidez is 25 whats your excuse 
and the gop incumbents david valadao mike garcia peter meijer don bacon steve chabot 
renewing roberto and signing ferran torres and christensen just proves it we need someone like tuchel or klopp stop hunting for the next zidane we don't have him 
that's where the money should go not on torres and roberto 
yes dembele should go so we can see ferran torres and collado on the wing next season 🔥🔥 with azpi and roberto as the fullbacks for the right back position 
memphis and de jong are way more important than ferran torres and roberto btw 
give them auba memphis torres umtiti sergio roberto you can even slide in dembele dest and oil merchant 
buy alexander isak of real sociedad for kane 
origi alexander isak patrick schick suarez there a few to ponder think there all good 👍🏿 
alexander isak isn't in the position to reject us for no ucl football 
over the summer u gotta buy alexander isak 
alexander isak we don't have that money bro 
currently managing newcastle halfway through the first season on original db i have signed tripper 23m gabriel 54m sekou mara prospect 8 75m bruno 35 5m g barbosa 17 5m 21m lodi 21m alexander isak 40m 
straight out of the box and without thinking about it too much most impressive tchouaméni he's been a major revelation for me personally most disappointing alexander isak his issues are partly down to la real's reoccurring inconsistency but i still expected a little more 
i seriously considered alexander fvcking isak 
every kid's favorite 
please ask him about luis suarez 😏 
luis diaz obviously this season and in the same league bruno fernandes before that and luis suarez much before that just to name a few sunderland got promoted and your head is gone dougie just a flurry of stupid tweets 
luis suarez 31 goals no penalties for liverpool 
romagnoli dembele luis felipe denayer di maria bernadeschi and perisic all of these are absolute quality and even if they're old still worth a 1 or 2 year contract not saying theyd come to us but would be good if we could suarez too all worth a punt 
brilliant achievement but many other players have done it over the years with more goals than son andy cole scored 34 in 40 games in 1993 1994 no penalties luis suarez scored 31 goals in 2013 14 also none of them penalties 
luis suarez is agood backup too 
dusted off your luis suarez is innocent shirt lately 
historically kenny dalglish but my heart says luis suarez 
swap ings for bissouma get koulibaly in the defence darwin nunez as the st and suarez as 3rd choice seasoned backup simple luis😆😉😜 
luis suarez is the best baseball player fr🙏🏽💯 
manchester city's sergio aguero is the all time leading scorer in the premier league but liverpool's luis suarez is the league's top scorer this season suarez is also the league's top scorer in goals scored in all competitions 
yeah right … it's simeone's fault he doesn't ask convince average players to join the club rather he asks legends like david villa and luis suarez to join the club 🥹🥹 
luis suarez would've liked this switch 
luis suarez coming on for lfc to bag 5 goals 
heard luis suarez is a free agent 
if we only had luis suarez 
when are you announcing luis suarez to charlotte fc 
apparently luis suarez is even a targeting on a free transfer 
and btw gerrard played with players like michael owen fernando torres xabi alonso luis suarez etc liverpool were always a top4 top 6 side they aren't as poor as u r claiming 
two words luis suarez 
are we talking about the same luis suarez 😅 
colombian is luis javier suarez watford seem to sign pretty decent young strikers would love us to sign joao pedro think he might be the prem brazilian both as well as dennis have been on watfords books 
still there's no better illustration of inflation than the fact you could buy luis suarez for £152 000 in 1961 
face of luis suarez 
i know what i am talking about it is easy to know how much huge amount paid for those players in that moment and other huge amount players like luis suárez if you are a barça fan but you do not know anything about the history of your club 
robert lewandowski zlatan ibrahimovic andrea iniesta luis suarez neymar jr they are unlucky to be around the same time as mercy and ronaldo 
mbappe is not even better than prime edinson cavani luis suarez or sergio aguero 
maitland niles diego costa at chelsea luis suarez at liverpool fabregas in 2010 mbappe last summer i could go on 
got to be luis suarez 
the same league that had their teams boasting about having the world's most expensive transfers i'm talking about c ronaldo gareth bale neymar jr luis suarez ousmane dembele philipe coutinho antoine griezmann etc all bought… 
can i get odds on luis suarez to sign for aston villa before 3rd september whatoddspaddy 
messi ibrahimovic lampard gerrard fabregas vieira luis suarez buffon roy keane mbappe pogba neymar verratti they all actually rejected mahodrid🥱🥱🥱🥱 
wizkid messi talented and dominating internationally burna boy ronaldo hardworking talented amp proud davido neymar talented hardworking but e no reach wiz amp burna level internationally olamide luis suarez talented and consistent with local dominance 
fr luis suarez is so underrated on this bird app 
with the experience he has and the calibre of player he once was in the prem he'd be quality for watkins and the younger lads to learn from i wouldn't say no to luis suarez for a season at the villa 👍🏽 
instead of neymar lets sign three good quality players last year so many wanted lukaku and look where we ended up we don't need expensive signings we just need talented players with grit like mane diaz diego costa mascherano luis suarez etc 
there's rumours that luis suarez is joining 
yes it's luis suarez for fooks sake we had a fella named james bree playing for villa not too long ago lads a decent player old bree but not uruguay's greatest ever goal scorer 
for a sec i thought i read lucas ocampos 🤣 
rdt as backup for karim lucas ocampos from sevilla bench vini rodrygo amp eden 👍 tchuameni mid ckm and cama fede ceballos is perfect theo hernandez as lb achraf as rb cb amp gk are great 🤔 sadio mane 
lucas ocampos is one of the best 
imagine having less champions league than kiko casilla 
felipe caicedo the best 
😂😂😂 i'd get felipe caicedo at this point 
phil foden has now won more premier league titles 4 than 🏆🏆🏆 frank lampard 🏆🏆🏆 cristiano ronaldo 🏆🏆🏆 patrick vieira 🏆🏆🏆 yaya touré he turns 22 years old next week 😁 
all these legends did not win the champions league but they are legends zlatan ibrahimovic ronaldo cesc fabregas francesco totti roberto baggio gabriel batistuta michael ballack patrick vieira

big moment 5 brahim diaz's goal against venezia the newly promoted side came to san siro to frustrate milan and they succeeded for most of the game it looked to be one of those days until bennacer shows great vision to pick out theo who cuts it back for brahim big goal 
seeing brahim diaz with the trophy ruined my year 
many congratulations diaz 💙 onceablue 🔵 
leave mbappe brahim diaz is legit lifting the scudetto as we speak 
happy for theo hernandez and brahim diaz 🕺🕺 
need maldini to hijack the deal asap either that or they buy him in 2023 after brahim diaz's loan ends so he only has to spend one year away from the ucl but preferably he heads to milan now to join the defending italian champions 
congrats from brahim diaz fans 
get brahim diaz back asap the guy is a gem 
we should get back brahim diaz him and rodrigo competing for the rw position might do the trick 
kingsley coman ou brahim diaz 
hell no i watch milan a lot for brahim diaz never get impressed by the boy doesn't get impressed by brahim either honestly sometimes yes but most of the times brahim seems to lack something the only thing i might praised leao is he know how to used his physical advantage 
on the contrary foden is just the most popular candidate in a long line of graduates who've either been sold or used sancho garcia zinchenko iheanacho brahim diaz etc just to name a few 
i'll sell jovic mariano and asensio ceballos marcelo isco bale get tchoaumeni nunez and antony and bring brahim diaz or kubo back from loan promote miguel or bring fran garcia into the squad 
bring back brahim diaz tchouameni reece james and antony and it's good for me or another world class rb and rw 
only 1 of them are on the team anymore if you wanted all time city you've got sancho kasper schmeichel sturridge trippier brahim diaz angelino denayer iheanacho 
time to go all in for some high rated full backs bring brahim diaz and kubo back enough with fifa career mode fix the areas that really need improvements 
yes bhai zlatan ibrahimovic made our dream true what a player he is 
my new fav tweet zlatan ibrahimović after winning the title i will continue playing if i feel good physically my decision will be made soon i had many physical problems but i will decide soon 🇸🇪 acmilan this scudetto is for raiola it's the first title i win … 
this guy is insane😂😂 zlatan ibrahimovic🔥 
all these legends did not win the champions league but they are legends zlatan ibrahimovic ronaldo cesc fabregas francesco totti roberto baggio gabriel batistuta michael ballack patrick vieira 
zlatan ibrahimovic when i came back two and a half years ago i told people i'm gonna bring milan back to the top and win them this scudetto — there weren't many people who believed many laugh as well but today there's a different tone 
i won't retire until i win a trophy with ac milan ❤️ zlatan ibrahimovic❤️ since his arrival in the team his influence both on amp off the pitch contributed a lot their victory what a legend ❤️ 
adding proven winners to this youthful milan squad was important too zlatan ibrahimović didn't have his finest season but milan's improvement since his 2020 return is evident ended a seven year title drought when he first joined in 2011 now ended an 11 year title drought 
you forgot one name zlatan ibrahimovic 
you and your colleague stevie are trash in the context of serie a and should now recognise the influence of zlatan ibrahimovic please retract your misguided statements make this happen 
him zlatan ibrahimovic spent most of the season hurt but guys like rafael leao sandro tonali and mike maignan took steps forward to prove they are emerging stars in the football world and have championship type character the challenge now for this milan team will be can 
thank you for sharing that it is a wonderful sport zlatan ibrahimovic just won a serie a title with ac milan today at age 40 
zlatan ibrahimovic at 41 years is still proving that he's better than ronaldo i'm taking him over ronaldo any day of the week 
for the past kaka beat vvd you dont accept that zlatan ibrahimovic beat him in height in cuteness etc c ronaldo dey there i combined his past and present look together it beat vvd 
we will never see players like cr7 leo messi and zlatan ibrahimovic 🐐🐐🐐 
zlatan ibrahimovic has always been one of my favorite players since i was a kid for his winning mentality and confidence level his belief in his words and the ability to do so is just unthinkable 
but after a few years when all the stars left i've also seen the club suffer a lot the last time ac milan won serie a was back in 2011 with zlatan ibrahimovic as their key man what a guy this man 
i won't quit until i have won something with this milan side a 38 year old zlatan ibrahimović returned to a struggling milan team today the 40 year old helps them lift their first serie a title in 11 years 🦁 
now i can pin this tweet congratulations ac milan congratulations zlatan ibrahimovic scudetto in the bag🙌🏻 
peep how zlatan was the first to applaud him when he stepped out that's a flex man that's top level you've to be really really outstanding to impress a guy like zlatan ibrahimovic 
zlatan ibrahimovic at 40 came back from the mls to win the scudetto for ac milan can't say same for ronaldo 🙄 
not just you all of us plus zlatan ibrahimovic the legend 
zlatan didn't bring a cigar but the cigar came by itself to celebrate with zlatan ibrahimovic 😂 
there's never gonna be another zlatan ibrahimovic 
no milan fan is ever gonna forget what he did and will always be in our hearts grazie zlatan ibrahimovic one of the best strikers of this generation 
rocky start for the fans the 5 0 game against atalanta felt like an all time law even in the banter era winter mercato brought back a familiar name zlatan ibrahimović and more experience with simon kjær

wande no b naymar o no disrespect the guy wande na zlatan ibrahimovic dude suppose don retire but he still de hit and biko how is rema haaland wetin d boy de sing wei deserve am rather rema na sancho much noise hype and girls little productivity 
it's illeism… many great political and sports figures did that throughout history most notable in our era was zlatan ibrahimović 
zlatan ibrahimovic rn is far better than asensio 2017 no cap 
star ⭐⭐ to their logo and kits will juventus get back to competing for the title next season and how will napoli fare with the likes of lorenzo insigne and possibily other big names leaving this summer can someone like lazio or roma get back into zona ucl next year and 
also have a debut to american dual nat patrick leal 
🇺🇸 patrick leal subs on to make his professional debut 🔁👏 
and now 03 patrick leal makes his serie a debut 
seems the coaching change did none of the american boys any favors patrick leal slid onto the first team bench today which was nice to see 
a mistake at the back nearly cost the crew a second as eloy room collided with josh williams right after cifuentes wins the ball off the goal kick dribbles past the crew defense and slots it home crew96 0 2 lafc 
62' lafc goal carlos vela sheds off a couple tackles and slots it past eloy room crew96 
we do have a need for a second striker behind miguel berry 
i'm not going to pay to watch miguel berry lose every aerial duel amp stand in 1 spot 90 of time 1st goal was on him same w room since his big payday he's been terrible as much as i'm frustrated with porter playing same guys every game i'm pissed bez constructed 💩 roster 
crew96 substitutions in luis diaz erik hurtado out yaw yeboah miguel berry crew96 0 2 lafc 
miguel berry with a chance right before the half as the ball ping ponged around the box but nothing came of it crew96 clbvlafc 
big claims to be signings of the season had luis diaz come to tottenham as had looked likely until liverpool dived in for him then it might have been even more crazy finish but we probably wouldn't have got kulu had that happened 
couldn't tell if i was watching kerwin vargas or luis diaz 
city are not clinical enough with their chances liverpool might be the most clincial team in europe right now your defense sucks you will play toni kroos as a starter luis diaz vs carvajal 
the new luis diaz 
luis diaz is better than u my friend 
f a m i l y m o t h e r maria diaz f a t h e r luis ortegas s i b l i n g s lj ortegas younger brother c h i l d r e n none o t h e r unknown 
luis diaz obviously this season and in the same league bruno fernandes before that and luis suarez much before that just to name a few sunderland got promoted and your head is gone dougie just a flurry of stupid tweets 
luis diaz costs more than 15 mil 
fyi luis diaz is skinnier than pulisic so if he can survive here so can ampadu 
for me i will pick luis diaz ahead of him 
who be luis diaz ah 
kdb graham potter werner sterling everton west ham in liverpool a 3 golu luis diaz 
luis diaz did this and liverpool fans went crazy loool 
here are my season rewards pots heung min son ypots bukayo saka signing of the season luis diaz martin odegaard flop of the season nuno tavares 🗿 underrated transfer marc cucurella manger of the year eddie howe 
to push city to the final day while contesting the other three trophies is absolutely amazing luis diaz a revelation in 2022 konate brilliant until some errors today quite a team 
please be luis diaz 
stop talk shit grealish is ovrrated biggest flop this season if we look his price luis diaz did better season and he even began in january 
yes he could have passed the damn ball to luis diaz and other teammates im just saying 👋🏻 
luis diaz al liverpool 
naa luis diaz was the best transfer bruno second 
they did an article a few days ago where they got luis diaz to sign for united on football manager to see how he'd get on i don't think what i've done is unjustified 😭😭 
goalkeeper of the season de gea defender of the season thiago silva midfielder of the season kevin de bruyne striker of the season luis diaz coach of the season eddie howe flop of the season player christensen useless club of the season united and arsenal 
luis diaz would like a word 
i love absolutely everyone in that team but luis diaz for me he's been absolutely incredible with so little time to adapt to our play style looked like he's been here for years can't wait to see what he's gonna be like next season and in the future❤️❤️ 
rodrygo and luis diaz winner receives 2 and skill move upgrade 
5 star skills luis diaz 
idk when i'll get released but yeah showdown him vs luis diaz 
luis diaz as he didn't get a tots or tots moments and rodrygo since he took real madrid to extra time in both the quarter finals and semi finals 
rodrygo or mendy would be so cool for madrid maybe a fabinho or luis diaz one for liverpool 
ok but are u mad or just bad because luis diaz isnt champion at pl ahjjajasdkfaksfdkaskfdaskf 
mendy hazard fabinho luis diaz i guess it will be valverde or casemiro and diaz or robertson 
grealish and luis diaz 
could be luis diaz level i reckon 
liverpool luis diaz 
yes he should assist to luis diaz in that play he missed playing alone when city was 0 2 down and with that goal and that pressure of liverpool winning the city would have never scored those 3 goals 
how did sancho do after scoring amp assisting bucket loads in germany scoring loads in norway austria and germany means nothing werner germany top scorer can't hit the net here ye of little faith luis diaz gt haaland all day haaland has zero skill in build up play 
luis díaz is raw talent though it is incredible because it literally is pure talent what got him out of colombia at that age and straight into europe he's got a huge future assuming klopp and his team can polish out his rough edges which are really bad at times ik 
i'll tell you guys a funny story tottenham had agreed everything with luis diaz in january barca informs tottenham that dembele is for sale they delay diaz signing to negotiate with dembele liverpool steps in and signs diaz covers gap with city from 14 points to 1 
mané had lost his 1 v 1 ability and firmino was a lot worse than people thought no surprise luis diaz comes in someone who's not even a superstar and we go on a run i don't know how we even won in 19 20 despite making no signings 
what a stupid comment that's what tyler does it's his job to build things up 
player of the season salah young player of the season saka signing of the season luis diaz flop of the season sancho goal of the season maybe rodri vs watford most improved player of the season martinelli 
until we signed luis diaz in january we barely had any cover and thank god we signed him without whom none of the cups or the title run in would have been possible 
talking about peripheral european nations so maybe he's portuguese so i'll guess he was talking about luis diaz 
you never want to lose a championship but of all the ways to lose that was the most thrilling way to do it already excited for champions league final next week and then a full season with luis diaz begins again in august up the reds lfc ynwa 
player of the season de bruyne young player of the season foden best signinf of the season luis diaz worst signing of the season varane breakout player of the season kulusevski flop of the season sancho manager of the season pep guardiola 
not only that but the energy in the stadium for that would be higher 
or maybe he's just more excited for the gundogan goal because it completes a 3 2 comeback to win the league 
that was his point 
come back when you've caught luis diaz up in trophies won lad diaz on 2 in 4 months how many you got in your career upto now pigeon s r 😎😎😎😎😎🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼 
warra premier league for both luis diaz and chelsea this season 
not as finished as chelsea and luis diaz are 
definitely tiago amp luis diaz are major threats but he's out injured with a hamstring luis diaz will be well taken care of by carvajal amp fede valverde 
son then luis diaz 
maybe if he squared the ball to luis diaz in the spurs game he would look a lot more happier 
but if villa had defended better liverpool would be better than city 😂😂 luis diaz will be gutted to hear he hasn't improved liverpool either 
ya melt enjoy your we avoided relegation party that's all you'll have to celebrate… luis díaz has been a red for 4 months and won more than you lot have in 27 years 😂 
he asked for luis diaz to start with 
luis diaz and kulusevski dicked on him in half a season 
luis díaz has been a red for 4 months and won more trophies than you have in 27 years 
luis diaz can still win the quadruple 
it's possible but can't see it either i had similar hopes about luis diaz but he's been incredible 
what did liverpool need that luis díaz arrived a couple of months earlier 🙌💪❤️ 
what a premier medal for luis diaz 
what did liverpool need that luis díaz arrived a couple of months earlier 💪💪💪💪💪❤️❤️ 
so what martin tyler is a city fan 
he could've passed to luis diaz during the tottenham game p 
luis diaz not winning the premier league feasting 
i have the tendency to support any team that have a colombian as a player really i don't feel that much affiliation for the team but i'm very found of luis diaz 
add luis diaz and jota to the list 
better than luis diaz 
at the end they won… now luis diaz … sorry liverpool will have the champions to win it will be a hard match 
nah our fanbase wants big name not actual ballers like son luis diaz 
few reports emerged that ralf had asked the club to sign vlahovic luis diaz and alvarez lets dive into it vlahovic never wanted to leave to italy whereas alvarez was scouted by city for two years diaz was chased by west ham but could not get the deal over the line 7 n 
luis diaz still a flop player livarpool still have a 1pl in 20 years 
if i were the owner of liverpool i would trade mane luis diaz and salah for u 
luis diaz definitely had a shot on target today 
the honeymoon period supporters gave luis diaz should be officially over he can't keep winning motm by showing nice skills but making wrong decisions mo selfish ass almost cost of the game but he is good for it so he gets a pass onto 2022 2023 season 
last point was so important for me… gw 28 wasn't brave enough to start cash with a dgw over cancelo with a sgw… the outcome 28 points gw 33 went for luis díaz on gw31 wc and benched him to start kulu bha when i was sure he would be the diff i needed outcome 12 pt 
well fair play to wolves they pushed us that was a tough game man c 3 goals in 5 min ducked us up 
do not forgot liverpool squad is 900 million and var decisions all favour for liverpool luis diaz is biggest impact for liverpool in second half of season 
how did luis diaz not have a shot on target 
pipe down luis diaz has won more trophies in 5 months than your shite have won in 30 years 
only league to have 9 0 scores almost every season 🤣 not to mention city wins every game like 4 0 and the so called hardest league gets dogged by new players every season example bruno luis diaz ruben dias kulusevski auba and salah when they rejoined de bruyne 
how it's a title deciding goal lmao what do you expect 
the players were incredible despite all the heat generated between mo and mane after afcon luis diaz is a dream signing and big divock leaves 
what is a luis diaz 
it was the draws in the end that did us but can't fault the team it's been an incredible season had we signed luis diaz in the summer the league would've definitely been ours 
we paid 60mil for ferran leeds will ask for something similar or a bit lower like luis diaz deal we don't know yet 
congrats 
he literally done it to mock carragher who's the most biased commentator on sky 
luis díaz should be left wing playing in the sideline that's his game 
was he even the best winger of this january window i'd argue luis diaz had a way bigger impact via being one of the key players for a literal quadruple charge 
5 goals 8 assists in 15 games and firing us to the ucl suck your luis díaz signing of the season agenda 
i mean luis diaz has been pretty good 
luis diaz maybe 
they're probably hoping they won't get sued by saying it's a satire or parody somewhere however that has not been a successful strategy for others 
luis diaz is better apparently 
until luis diaz wins liverpool the league in 2023 
nah he would be overshadowed by luis diaz and his gang he'd be cleaning their boots if he went to liverpool 
eddie dropped 100 bodies on bobby edmundo luis miguel diaz estoy avergonzada not his real middle name but it felt right 
top pickup 🔝 luis diaz i've been a big fan of luisito for a while i had the first waiver in january when he signed so he was an obvious pickup for me the colombian was incredible in his 11 starts 13 apps averaging about 12 ppg more importantly he was a joy to watch 
yep man's a predator when he's in form great awareness in the area trouble is he's not been in those spaces enough luis diaz running round like a madman trying to instigate things whereas diogo looks lost 
what we will hear is it's luis diaz 
praying we score another goal now😭 luis diaz for the premier league winner goal i'd probably cry😂😂 
luisdiaz luis díaz should play left wing as in the porto 
luis diaz is the one that makes me the most nervous carvajal has his work cut out 
cancelo and luis diaz i call you for the last time this season 🙏 step up boys help he get back to the top three 
couldn't tell u 
fire stick vpn 
be a fire stick mate 
thiago and luis diaz…boss 
what program is that 
idk man if militao turns up we're good i'm just afraid of luis diaz against carvajal salah will be in mendy pockets mane doesn't scare me mans losing his pace 
this isn't luis diaz 
i sold havertz for luis diaz 🤣😣😣😣 
i'm switching between games tbh luis diaz mane and taa might cause a few problems 
clear of luis diaz😍 
if luis diaz is going to continue to be liverpools only creative playmaker they are going to lose this came and the ucl final big chances gotta come from someone else man 
luis diaz will be history in the final i declare it from now on you will remember me i just hope to have an autographed shirt from the whole team blessing liverpool 🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴

salah to son or salah watkins to luis diaz kane for a 4 good luck mate 
naa are you really asking this luis diaz is even clear of pulisic 
imo salah should've got a break post afcon the guy lost a final after carrying alongside the goalkeeper and he was playing like the best player itw before then klopp should've given him a full week 2 week break as we were coping without him and we signed luis diaz then as well 
bruno g wilson luis diaz 
i mean its true who have liverpool bought luis diaz 
luis diaz or maddison barnes 
stat merchant lt use football with your eyes

as players they would want to be in the cl as soon as they sign vlahovic achieved his goal by moving to juve luis diaz achieved it at liverpool and pulisic got it at chelsea no one will think oh i will help arsenal for 1 or 2 years they want it now 
one last nugget of wisdom for me ash do i play safe with the eo or go for it with my cap choice options of son kane mount luis diaz i'm 3rd in my ml by about 15 points no chance of 1st 🌍 25 4k 
from nigeria luis diaz will score the first goal mark my words 
liverpool will win and my favorite player is luis diaz hé will make this win possible 
liverpool luis diaz 
luis diaz touch and bicycle kick assist alisson pickord impression 
luis díaz 🔴 the columbian only joined liverpool in january but he has already made a huge impact finding his place in the starting 11 62 points and 7 g a in only 12 games shows the talent he has due to salah's injury he looks set to start against wolves in gw38 
pencelo not clear of scotlands captain 
luis diaz best january signing ever 
hey guys would you take a 4 for coutinho richarlison out luis diaz random fwd in or just coutinho out madders in 🤔 
mental isn't it yet your manager sits there talking about how everyone loves us yet foden and kdb get the awards they nowhere near deserve weird bloke you got there 
i'm doing coutinho to luis diaz or maddison any suggestions on who i should go with 
contemplating a 4 of kdb and jesus to luis diaz and kane unless i hear vardy starts … if u had both the spurs boys would u captain kane 
in my mini league the guy above me has luis diaz and he's 30 points ahead the guy 10 points behind me has mount shall i get mount or diaz can't get both…i'm planning to capt kdb who the guy above me doesn't have to make up the 30 help 
he literally was nominated for poty meanwhile robbo is still fighting the davies comparisons behave yourself 😭 
🔴what would the data analysts be able to do ▶️replacing a star player coutinho wanted to leave so they upgraded with luis diaz amp depending on salah amp mane ▶️ knowing the other and adapting the self reading the opponents tactics and adapting to the opponents weaknesses 
in my mini league the guy above me has luis diaz and he's 30 points ahead the guy 10 points behind me has mount shall i get mount or diaz can't get both…i'm planning to capt kdb who the guy above me doesn't have to make up the 30 help

i'm in a similar position mate personally thinking cash to sess and coutinho to luis diaz or jota 
i'll have a luis diaz shirt cause we are gonna win 🤞 
liverpool luis diaz 
luis diaz once it is possible 
anyone other than luis diaz is wrong 
stats can be made to whatever you want it to be you would expect a forward to have better stats here kdb totally deserves it salah has dropped in form since luis diaz arrived 
raphinha 25 leeds united idk why any madridista or even any team even mention him he's so good and hasn't even hit his prime yet he's the rw equivalent of luis diaz 
tbf they did sign luis diaz 
you can get luis diaz for 38 million he'd run through a brick wall for you and if your auntie was sick he'd pop round and cheer her up 
and chambers 
all players have really stepped up to a top gear this season the addition of luis diaz in january changed the complexion of the club one of the signings that excited fans much before the signings was done it created a huge fanfare btw club and the fans 
in my opinion he's a good footballer and worths 45 50m pounds he played quite well and carried aston villa at that time his price should be around luis diaz's 
the nervous water drinking 😂😂 i honestly have no belief that city will drop points… but somewhere in there the hope is ready to kill 
decent i would have put luis diaz instead of mane and maybe kulusevski instead of mount but the rest of that side is solid 
i have 8 1m in the bank if i sell zaha how about zaha gt luis diaz for a 4 hit 🤔 can't convince myself for the hit don't see much upside diaz ceiling is not very high and can get subbed off based on city game 
what are the luis diaz goal odds please there is nothing showing 
i would like a luis díaz shirt 
changes done richarlison to toney michael keane to sessengon amp zaha to luis diaz the goat 
lewis transferred in schmeichel earning 8 points alonso earning 7 points de bruyne earning 30 points mount earning 13 points maddison earning 8 points luis díaz earning 15 points dennis earning 2 points jesus earning 2 points 85 points in 
congratulations new uefa world champions 2022 lucho luis diaz 1

nope i think first 10mins 
happy birthday bro🤟 
thanks mate got some light now 😂 btw who's the best transfer between these two a luis diaz and kane b mane and toney 
the same milan that's top of serie a on final day of season yep that shows you how good the group is vs lfc quad chasers porto w luis diaz amp athletico spanish champs might be a surprise but someone has to finish bottom genius 😂🤣 brugge or leipzig would've added 0 quality 
who do you think is on penalty duties now for liv if salah doesnt play is it mane milner and fabinho dont appear in any predicted lineup if he isnt i see and upside to go for luis diaz 
🙏🏼 luis diaz pretty please 
we thought it was luis diaz but it was deki 🤩 
instead of neymar lets sign three good quality players last year so many wanted lukaku and look where we ended up we don't need expensive signings we just need talented players with grit like mane diaz diego costa mascherano luis suarez etc 
luis diaz hat trick 😉 
fpl gw38 transfers 8 gordon richarlison amp cash gt luis diaz toney amp sessegnon 🫡 son yet another season is almost in the books looks like it's going to be a close one whether or not i beat last years or 🤞 only trent and toney left from my gw1 team 😅 good luck ⚽️ 
luis diaz on mines please 😮‍💨💯🙏🏽 
salah and generational don't joke with that one you'd be better off calling luis diaz generational or even kdb

we have also been watching mueller ever since and nothing has changed my mind and i go there regularly not sure about chris but i'd guess the same it's the uncanny valley of density not dense enough to walk regularly for errands but too dense for driving 
russian oligarch oleg deripaska spent 20m helping mueller's fbi in 2009 deripaska hired chris steele to dig up dirt on manafort for a lawsuit while steele was also working for dems on the dirty trump dossier manafort kept 3 properties after trump's pardon 
just watch the ongoing sussman trial and you'll see all the evidence you need hillary's campaign paid ex russian spy chris steele for the fake dossier now let's see your evidence for all these russians trump supposedly met with cause mueller's investigation proved nothing 
can you provide any evidence of anything you have just said

as a long time rams fan i'm sad to say i think it's time for aaron to retire he's accomplished so much no amount of money is worth the risk go out on top big guy 
i'd say it began long ago the conspiracy theory is just now surfacing as truth 
the gibralter protocol hasn't been implemented in full either because gb made a balls of thst too 
the uk suggestions are unworkable they don't protect the single market from the lowered food standards in gb 
they aren't obligated to worsen their deal because it benefits the uk a deal is a deal propose a better deal or come to the table and work it out 
i didn't suggest that i just think both countries have acted ridiculously and hurt their citizens badly and they should both get a grip and negotiate a long standing peace but nato need to be instrumental in this also it's all just escalating and all sides caused it 
i'm sorry my selection let you all down i'm devastated it's been a long season amp thank fuck it's over 
maybe because it takes 2 to tango 
how long until the new pride flag is also judged problematic 2 years 
how many people went on to decide they weren't left handed after all aaron of course if they had unlike detransitioned people they wouldn't have to deal with the life long after effects of unnecessary major surgery amp wrong sex hormones 
the problem is most don't understand the bible because they have never read it it a good read now some parts are long and boring but much is really good stuff jonah and the whale samsom and delilah are in judges 1st and 2nd samual are my favorite 
i spent so long this afternoon trudging through such boring shit about a character scrolling through his phone sending texts…finally was like fuck this just jump to the dude he needs to meet walking into the bar 
as long as aaron wanbisaka and maguire don't play for my club iam good 😭 
they're not opposed to improving it and they have their own proposals on the table that would remove 80 of checks 
remember aaron just like daniel hannan still peddle the lie the eu triggered article 16 he's not to be taken seriously 
comedy gold from the tory policy exchange to paraphrase ni business have reacted very quickly the protocol is working very well for them none of the chaos amp problems we have in gb well we can't be having that 
as a chiefs fan if we get to keep them long term give me myles garrett for one year aaron donald

pleaseeeee the gif the guy on the cover is awolnation aka aaron bruno he used to have really long hair but i guess he cut it recently 
in that panel he cites the case of moses' own second in command aaron implying that there's long been no charge of destiny for leaders only necessity 
drag him into a fray he left a long time ago at least in principle we all have our moments for sure and then blaming him for inaction but that is precisely the point 
hello officer long time no see sf has low drug prices because california is where fent comes in quit posting your stupid charts you shill 
more dishonest misrepresentation of from your statement that she denies the existence of british proposals is a flat out lie 
you gotta youtube her but long story short she's one of aaron's manson girls as crazy as crystal ann but pretends she's better and a good christian woman 
ah right google 🤦🏻‍♂️ 
gotta think phillips is a big question and what they do with the fee if they sell him they also need cb s maybe they can finally pull off that aaron long to pl transfer 
hasn't the guts to admit she never read the nip before calling for its vigorous implementation 
you said always bro that's a long time no one knows what's gonna happen in the future also that's a lie but i'll admit you've been more successful recently but it's fine bro you think about all that past success whilst i'll be focusing on us playing ucl this year coming😋😋😋😋 
aaron long like two years ago when european clubs were sniffing around but it's a bit late for him 
aaron long to leeds to shore up the defense 🤪 
lib journo ridiculed for claiming record turnout in ga doesn't mean it's not harder' to vote the liberal media has long had a record of disregarding facts creating and clinging to a narrative that suits them so called journalist aaron rupar is no exception 
indeed did i just imagine 'oven ready deal' it seemed quite prevalent in 2019 
even when they were in work nothing was delivered 
didn't the conservatives stand on a platform of not needing further negotiations 
when i was victim of a godley pile on once and tried to defend myself it wasn't long before i found myself being taunted about sensitive personal health related issues they were obviously getting it from somewhere his list seemed the obvious conclusion 
indeed might not be long before they find themselves regularly mistaken for peter murrell 🤣 
nope she's right how many times must you be reminded uk gov negotiated applauded sold to parliament and unionists and signed the oven ready' deal backtracking too late 
agree w aaron here posted a long thread on this yesterday this isn't a mass vax type of disease not new discovered 65 years ago in humans outbreak strategy known slow moving symptomatic spread just not the same 
as long as you're happy aaron i don't care about united anymore 
i'm fairly confident that economically viable fusion is closer than we currently think it's been 10 years away for song long yet it's made such rapid progress in just the last few it's sneaking up on us 
this looks like the round you're deciding to go for it this year or play a longer game and you can do either with your current build i love the discount on aaron jones as a possible top 5 guy this year and next pittman if you really want to build a long term wr foundation 
the fact that aaron long gets called in multiple times and brooks doesn't makes me crazy 
john oliver has looked and chosen over integrity i'm so disappointed in the comedians it's their job to puncture this bullshit weakest generation of comics in a long time 
aaron donald has like 1 maybe 2 years left he's not really committed to playing long term and yeah i'd rather have terrell than ramsey especially with age amp contract terrell is more of what we need anyways 
it's apparent mike wants aaron ganval and king smith you can tell he's been around crystal ann too long 🤣🤣 
so yeah i'll block nazis but i'll also block the follow police and qanon psychos and election truthers and tankie fucks and anyone else who meets my irrational amp intolerant bigot bar aaron can do what he wants but i think it saves everyone energy in the long run 
do any journalists hold him accountable when he says shit like this as if aaron long is viable compared to a stud in the bundesliga 
sir you would be wrong aaron doesn't have it in him gb life long fan 
lmsooooo yo i cant with aaron only he would wear black long socks on vacation 
brooks has been playing in a 2 cb system most of his career and somehow it's never been a huge problem in the bundesliga or the champions league i guess that's not good enough for the usmnt tho we need guys at the highest level like aaron long 
we've been mutuals for a long time and it's been great i am so glad we can connect over our love for star wars and share our thoughts 😄 
you have to the right remain long terrible i know 
please don't give up okay you still a long journey to go we are all supporting u and aaron from the back its okay to lose but dont give up okay keep on fighting and keep on going if u feel tired just rest and take a deep breath okaayy🥺🥺 
i've been a huge fan of yours for so long you helped me feel confident in my love for the sequels more specifically tlj and tros 
long neck looking ass 
at least russ pretends to work in between the dumping and fraudulent schemes just dumps and retweets all day if saitama was legit he'd been fired long ago aaron is laziest and worst marketing manger ever lockupelonmansur his girl htn too 💋💋 shes part of scam 
and if the british establishment had simply left ireland in 1920 the troubles would never have happened if the british had listened to ireland's suggestion of un troops instead of antagonistic british soldiers and a racist police force the conflict wouldn't have lasted as long 
aaron if this is the way all fights going forward are to be judged i have no issue with it…… as long as we see consistency in that interpretation as everyone knows the first time we see consistency in judging will be the first time in history it's ever occurred ufcvegas55 
should be aaron long sucks also justin said strongest he's not accepting ggg's garbage favoritism and making starting 11s based on bad evaluations anyone doing those predictions is functionally manufacturing consent for terrible decisions it's bad content 
sorry this is taking me so long to get to i'm just busy 
looking exactly like the freddie freeman situation all over again aaron best believe the team will do what's necessary to stay competitive and they won't wait long braves laid a new blueprint for how these things are handled and teams will follow suit with their stars 
it also just occurred to me to tell my one mile time best i've done is a mile in 5 26 seconds the beforehand is the best i've done long distance 
i hear you but its not like we don't have examples of jedi who failed and then reached enlightenment that was yoda and obi wan's journey i'm not saying i wanted super hero luke but i've waited a very long time to see the order restored and they just didn't disappointed 
as long as they have aaron rodgers people will call them a super bowl contender no matter how many times he continuously loses in the first round of the playoffs 
yep… so happy they lost… hopefully out of government for a long time 
also add caden clark 
i thought he'd been hacked 
because we didn't make a play for dayne pickering st clair

it's the best courtney marie andrews does a great cover 
paul rest we've all had a long day my dear brother rest lol 
and ben mee hope he breaks a sweat 
training i wrestled in high school and would train in three layers of sweats not a drop of sweat during competition today i'm fat and out of shape and if it's above 70f and 50 humidity i'm soaked 
add ben stokes sam curran or mitchell starc to the mix and that team will win trophies without breaking a sweat 😏 
fun fact this event took place in the same building that hosted a bunch of mfc events i saw the likes of douglas lima paul daley nick thompson ryan jimmo pat healy ryan ford emanuel newton john alessio and sokoudjou compete there 
he did have a tough ask trying to create something on the right side with nick lima behind him there will be some tweaking there i'd imagine

we're through enough games now where i'm ready to say facundo torres just isn't as explosive or creative as i expected him to be not saying he's done poorly but compared to other young south american newcomers like almada and velasco his play just isn't as exciting thoughts 
72' sub jake mulraney comes on for facundo torres 1 2 atxvorl 
make a package that includes nylander and mrazek for scheifele and hellybuck leafs would have to add young prospect and pick they get top flight goalie and good player with high compete go sign reilly smith bunting am marner smith jt scheifele fill out the rest 
i would like you to talk about the offensive line coaches the ability they have to develop young talent like josh ball tyler smith matt waletzko matt farniok 
kyle law and aaron smith great representation for the fusion gentlemen congrats to all the guys who made this team well done 
joe thuney and trey smith should be up there pff is a joke and people should take it with a grain of salt 
kyle we're baptists we don't bet 
if you drop down the original filter to 2 stl 2 blk you add 21 22 orlando robinson 16 17 kenrich williams 14 15 dorian finney smith 11 12 robert covington 10 11 matt howard 08 09 kyle singler amp 07 08 robbie hummel to the list both lists work at 15 dr or 10 dr 
kyle smith idk i'm not following baseball 
juju smith schuster chrome 150 beckett coa 
should have actually hit him and made it worth the call smith was flopping like a fish all night 
kyle smith losing his shit at the end really drove home for me how frustrated they all were they've been better on the discipline front this year without nani who i think amped it up but i felt for them last night 
i believe in kyle's rep as a qb whisperer who has been to 2 sbs and missed out on another one last year he wanted to follow the smith mahomes model and he's sticking to his plan trey starts in year 2 and jimmy g gets traded 😊👍💯 
they make front bidets to help with that 
kyle lewis was the pick behind collins and will smith of the dodgers went right after burdi in the same draft pretty freaking pathetic showing for the sox that year 
you all hate when fans are approaching you in public but you don't want to admit cause they are the reason you make money 
kyle crossed no state lines legal for citizens especially for one that works in the other state like kyle did with any weapon smith amp wesson semi automatic is in no way a military rifle wi is an open carry state legal at 16 to possess a legal long gun self defense is legal 
willie horton on harp luther johnson on guitar pinetop perkins on piano charles calamese on bass willie big eyes smith on drums legendary 
key word in this report early buckle up this was meant to happen flames in 7 smith doesn't play game 7 because he can't play with big boys any more 
couldn't agree more smith dove 3 times in that game 3 lucic not fazed you want to dive all game smitty go for it you played well enough to win as a goaltender that's it you are an average at best but hats off to you tonight don't forget 4 goals in 7 min of game 1 👏

yeah kyle smith would have barely passed midfield at that point 
it's not fair to emmitt smith to remind people that emmitt smith is the money mark for that team 
self report 
was emmitt smith a team owner unavailable 
honestly this could be a kyle smith review and i wouldn't know the difference 
lost an aerial to collen warner anyone who attacks the ball beats him

sebas is the first dynamo player to win player of the week since cubo torres in april 2017 he joins will bruin 2011 as the only dynamo players to win player of the week in their first season in mls holditdown 
well is semi linked to let's make it happen and will bruin lives down here 
he said he will never play for any other team and he said he hates montreal grew up a nordiques fan and been a bruin since he was 18 it's a fact 
once a low life bruin always a low life bruin lucic will probably miss the next game 
which is why again everyone was more or less on board biden was operating well within the bounds of what was considered sound policy back then and the markes agreed if they didn't long term bond prices would have fallen sharply 
which is why although i am willing to say that in hindsight stimulus should have been less i cannot say that it was evident the fed went along market analysts went along the bond market gave signs of going along this was not the work of one stubborn person as you suggest 
because that was the moment when the risk assessment changed from being afraid of a downturn to being afraid of inflation and during all that time the markets went along as you could see with bond markets 
don't know also 
based on adam makos's 2014 book chronicles the unlikely bond between pioneering navy airman jesse brown played by jonathan majors and tom hudner glen powell during the korean war 🔗 
low star servants 1 3 stars only got coins for their bond that part is intended and not a bug 
jonathan and joyce would loooove the greatful dead thats how they would bond by going to concerts n stuff

smart is out derrick white is starting williams is playing which is ok bc the celtics win when rob plays 
boston celtics marcus smart draft payton pritchard draft derrick white trade jaylen brown draft jayson tatum draft grant williams draft al horford trade daniel theis trade robert williams iii draft 
daniel theis is in the rotation for a lighter role if time lord is out with al horford playing a more valuable center role and grant williams also getting a minute bump if he sits derrick white and payton pritchard pick up most or all of smart's minutes if he is out 
derrick gore is darrel williams 2 0 
derrick favors ty jerome and kenrich williams for pick 4 works for both teams 
yall so damn hard on him he could beat derrick henry in every stat and still be called trash garuntee most of you say that darrel williams was better last season but i'd love to see the stats that show it 
what is this series robert williams is out oh yeah well kyle lowry is out now marcus smart is out now jimmy butler is out now derrick white is out now tyler herro is out do the basketball gods hate us this much 
the lagalaxy got the wrong one going 2 0 down after starting the game with derrick williams on the bench he and a raft of other subs came on at 60' but they couldn't turn the tide against houston who lost 3 0 coybig irishabroad 
can't say i remembered the derrick williams part but he might've had the best night of his career 31 points 5 boards 5 steals
