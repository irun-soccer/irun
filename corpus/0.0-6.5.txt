gomes addams is a better option than andre gomes and he was a wizard

drogba scored a header and caused a penalty in the extra time😅😅 pete cech was the real savior of chelsea that day andre gomes wan kill us that day seh him and muller 😅 where the werey dey sef 
and if this was done for malcom can you honestly say there weren't more cases andre gomes and mina are two players who were in similar situations to malcom under valverde 
jack butland will accidentally let it slip through his fingers before the end 
30' eve 0 1 cry hoping he proves me wrong but i think gomes needs to go off at half time is putting us in dangerous situations way too much and it's been half an hour richarlison had a chance but it was an easy save for jack butland good work from gordon 
anderson tyrick for me in the last 4 games has to be love the fella proper south london 
13 crystal palace grade b pots guehi gallagher zaha mitchell or mcarthur yes all of these fots jordan ayew or nathaniel clyne

nathaniel clyne might be cooked but he seems like someone who would end up in mls 
don't be like doris 
for reference this would put him second in the pl for outfield players behind only joachim andersen there's not much else of note despite being 6 2 he seems only average in the air he's not shot averse but he's not very good at them he makes quite a few fouls 5 6

it’s like edward nketiah was using airtel the smartphone network ooooo tonight https t co pipijnwtbo

the only ones at 20 and 21 are saka martinelli and esr 3 players out of 11 
so what’s our depth looking like gk ramsdale turner rb tomiyasu new signing cb saliba white gabriel holding lb tierney hickey tavares cm tielemans partey xhaka new signing rw saka new signing nelson cam ødegaard lw esr martinelli st jesus nketiah balogun 
saka ødegaard martinelli white gabriel tomi partey esr and ramsdale just to name a few but when you rely on two strikers who are leaving in the summer to get enough goals to fire you to a ucl spot your asking for a lot of luck we need 5 or 6 players for depth and support https t co zdrklte2ys 
white 24 gabriel 24 tierney 24 tomiyasu 23 partey 28 lokonga 22 saka 20 ode 23 esr 21 martinelli 20 nketiah 22 add 2 3 quality players to this squad amp it will challenge for things in 2 3 years time all these players will peak in 2025 26 such a young squad 
odegaard and smith rowe in particular were appalling 
this is a learning curve for these young arsenal players ødegaard saka martinelli smith rowe ramsdale gabriel white etc europe league theoretically may be better for those players although many factors such as fatigue have played a role in this disappointment the 
what he'll do next is blame injuries for this position ramsdale tomiyasu white gabriel lokonga smith rowe odegaard martinelli saka lacazette only tierney is out with tavares a regular this season filling in pepe and leno on the bench with average xhaka there too 
martinelli for smith rowe lacazette for tavares and pepe for gabriel 
huge shoutout to all the players for giving everything they had all season long aubameyang lacazette nketiah martinelli saka smith rowe pepe ødegaard partey xhaka elneny lokonga tierney tavares gabriel white holding tomiyasu cedric ramsdale amp leno 
nketiah double brace martinelli brace odegaard brace gabriel 1 goal arteta with the final goal 
captainhindsight 
looking at ramsdale gabriel martinelli and even saka desperation has really gone to their heads 
a bit from gabriel at times if you can call him young probably not so much but other than martinelli it just looks like a side that is deflated when they should be fired up 
ngl i think everyone needs to go barring martinelli saka ø esr gabriel white tomiyasu ramsdale amp every1 means arteta edu amp all the backroom staff too give arteta this next szn to see what we do but if it doesnt improve amp we capitulate then it’s inevitable anyways 
the only good transfers since the 14 15 season are probably odegaard tomiyasu gabriel martinelli aubameyang should have sold him before the extension your hit rate can't be that low and be a champions league team 
arteta’s decision to start rowe ahead of martinelli was wrong taking gabriel out for pepe was wrong as well sending martinelli to lb was wrong poor performance let’s go to europa it’s not all bad 
don't be it's just sad for players like gabriel white ramsdale saka and martinelli who've been great this season odegaard and smith rowe too 
it just means you aint a big club and that's calm and what makes this funnier is we have gabriel bro saka martinelli bro we got ø how about some champions league football you smelly fuck 
tomi fucked gabriel fucked laca fucked martinelli fucked esr fucked saka fucked

broja che adams livramento jwp salisu there's defo talent to built around on the other hand they're only 6 points off 11th so maybe he's actually done a good job and they just need a bit more quality 
but djenepo and walcott are not good enough and i think we saw that last season and this season as well i can't talk on minamino he is not at the club but i thought he was ok 
adam armstrong 15m che adams 15m moussa djenepo 12m theo walcott 75 grand a week minamino little effect on squad 
i think time is up for rh they need a new voice che adams should not be sitting at bench until 83rd minute 
romeu wasn't used che adams didn't start only to be subbed on around 80' their keeper who has been exceptional too didn't play fraser forster

premier league southampton vs liverpool substitution liverpool 65' off 67 harvey elliott on 27 divock origi 
but i don’t think klopp goes for a sentimental sub here unless he keeps the midfield and throws on diaz and origi together 
and anyway that would take away the excitement of an inevitable late origi winner 👀
