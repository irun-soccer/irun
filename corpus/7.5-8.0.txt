jorginho deserves big respect though and is a better player 
we’re also much smarter as a football community to be saying ‘8 defensive players’ meaning an overall defensive philosophy 3 of those 8 includes james alonso and jorginho and if you think their role is focused ‘defensively’ then i’d advise you watch back and rethink 
kovacic has been our best cm this season kante has had some great games but you can’t build a side around him now sign rice and then you can use kante and kova in rotation and so get the best out of both 
the only players doing their best at a high level are thiago james mount rudiger kovacic chalobah it's unfortunate that kante has dropped form jorginho doesn't understand what it means to play progressive ball as a midfielder 
how he was d best lb n helped d club win d league keep trying to undermine his achievements cuz of hate alonso has been crucial to chelsea ever since he came thats how u guys dont appreciate mikel maluoda jorginho they are not top pro to only you 
i also find the kante slander so strange before this season you were crucified for ever criticizing him but now it’s become the opposite this fanbase is shocking it’s a matter of kovacic vs jorginho vs kante 24 7 
have pulisic odoi ziyech werner and lukaku as forwards and jorginho as his midfielder not forgetting alonso playing and sarr and chaloba on the bench and oh kennedy saul cheek and christensen all playing for him the man has suffered a lot he deserves it 
this means that chelsea probably won’t be able to build their midfield around him anymore considering the kind of player kanté is a jorginho kovacic midfield probably won’t be enough one between gallagher amp rice is needed next season 
he doesn't play as deep as jorginho but here's one when he actually plays deeper https t co wnvyw0u0qx 
look at liverpool how many players did they sell after their last champions league trophy 🏆 chelsea are throwing away the whole squad that won them ucl trophy 
silva was ok nothing special not much to do mendy not bad though he may feek he could have done better for that maddision goal jorginho and kante played well ziyech was sharp just needs to pick his rime to shoot tried form everywhere set pieces corners werent great 
e be like say i go soon turn jorginho oooo all these fud don dey tire me 
idk how likely it is that we get tchouameni if we do then we could potentially sell if it's a good price but with jorginho potentially leaving it wouldn't be that wise to let kanté go 
jorginho locatelli pogba feeding di maria vlahovic chiesa could be interesting 
jorginho is the person that we should get rid of he's the architect and influencer of this boring and frustrating sideways passings football we witness week in week out 
if i see shit like this about alonso and or jorginho i would be convinced that he’s purposefully sabotaging the club 
pulisic donkey werner donkey alonso donkey jorginho donkey havertz donkey tuchel head donkey 
i had such high hopes for ac this season the way it's turned out in the worst possible way and jorginho missing world cup as well footy gods hate me 
i dey criticize everybody but na when e reach kante and tuchel una fav una go begin attack me but jide here clearly hates jorginho 
then he did something with rudiger jorginho and werner last season you lots don't realise that players mentality plays alot in football no matter how good the coach tactics is if d players don't have the mentality nothing will come out of it 
havertz jorginho all need to go 
pulisic n jorginho should be the first on the 🚉 
the decision making from the players is abysmal 
he was part of the press while alonso was watching the ball kante let his man pick up the ball in space and shoot but yeah it's jorginho someone in a totally different event during the goal theres absolutely no room for balance when cfc fans discuss the players 
barkely werner jorginho azip rudi alonso ziyech rlc odoi sarr saul lukaku let them go👉 
https t co zs4gqkdtpo 
jorginho is clear he is going nowhere 
he’s my player and i support him with my full chest no dey sweet talk jide jorginho dey really deal with am 
buy sarr odoi and jorginho…take werner and pulisic free 
not to mention the rest of the deadwood in the squad azplicueta jorginho werner christiansen alonso even through he scored pulisic all garbage 🗑 
ziyech had a superb game too silva is just so smooth lukaku showed some good moments as well jorginho is so important as a defending mid fielder alonso scored a beauty and finally how did pulisic miss that sitter 
jorginho saul barkely 
jorginho shouldve had a hatrick 😂😂😂😂 
pirlo is twice the player jorginho will ever be 
ronaldo miller kane jorginho bruno benzema mbappe 
jorginho is an 8 to try and improve the press seemingly 
kante i love this man quite injury prone now so he's got a season or two left in him can see rice replacing him next year keep jorginho inconsistent some games he's magical others he's just shit too frustrating sell 
i'll rather sell jorginho instead of kante there needs to be a balance and a guiding head around this young squad maintaining amp infusing our winning culture is key 
funny asf 
gallagher gilmour to come back then a signing preferably rice amp kova to that and we are nice 
pogba is a free agent di maria is a free agent perisic is a free agent acerbi swapped with rugani jorginho has 1yr left on his contract those are the veterans will we be able to splash money on promising talent like raspadori molina and a young experienced cb i hope so 
jorginho is more meant to find lukaku than kante but alas and part of the reason he's having to scramble is jorginho can't make up ground 
azpi is def finished werner not good enough pulisic has his moments jorginho good lukaku not suitable for our style of play cho not good 
the average age of the squad was also much higher than ours 
christensen rudiger lukaku and kante or jorginho to move on 
jorginho and alonso are very good footballers with certain limitations our attackers are just not good footballers at all 
jorginho doesn’t create much 
him and jorginho to go promote billy for one position and use all the money on another midfielder… 🍚 
let jorginho go we get a dm and then we will see 
conte used him beautifully with matic helping out with our defense having jorginho forces more defensive duties on alonso 
jorginho that wants to kill me with sideways passes 
if we sell jorginho before him i cba 
add jorginho to the list 
world class is also not a requirement he needs to he world class in his role of captain 
pickford azpilicueta maguire ben white walker foden jorginho fernandes bernardo silva richarlison kane subs ramsdale mount james maddison dele alli vardy 
his top scorer last season was jorginho… he shouldn’t be getting banners he should be getting summoned to the hague 
jorginho and kante just keep moving it side to side hoping the wing backs do something 
ziyech alonso jorginho rudiger man i feel so sorry for tuchel 🐍 s will all leave 
azpilicueta alonso christensen rudiger lukaku jorginho saul pulisic amp werner are all either leaving want to leave or aren’t happy with game time 🤣miracle how we’ve reached 70pts 
kovacic would remain withdrawn to offer assistance to jorginho with ball progression and defending counters same with james who is inverted sounds like a complex structure but that's what we get for having so many tactical mismatches

ft is just overrated tbh 
some twitter nerds will tell you we need a certain english bulldozer 
i'd cash in on jorginho this summer as i agree with 
i do worry about too much youth in the team what we need now is experience and consistency 
oh and udogie and molina as the fullbacks are currently being worked on i’ve given up with names and my autocorrect now 
jorginho staying 
and arsenal won’t let partey go this summer

di maria jorginho or paredes bremer a solid left back but what would make me happier is letting go of bernardeschi arthur sandro and ramsey 
god forbid jorginho has competition 😱😱 
chalobah silva rudiger james webster jorginho hall mount havertz vale 
roll up next season with injury prone kova and kante and a tired jorginho see what happens 
jorginho carrick rodri more physical deep line play maker 
im asking for a general definition of dm it’s not about jorginho it’s about a definition that will allow me to sort players into which players are dms and which are not 
you cannot challenge for title without a goal scorers when was the last time we had a player that scored 20 goals jorginho stats are elite not just individually we conceded fewest goals itl with him in the team and most without him 
jorginho is the glue yes he gets run over sometimes but he is still the best midfielder we have forget kovacic and kante nonsense 
this is literally napoli jorginho all over again he obviously didn’t get blown past him because he had gattuso next to him so don’t be stupid 
he's a box to box midfielder not an anchor like jorginho the only successor to jorginho so far is gilmour 
jorginho 👏 is 👏 better 👏 
swap out jorginho for a ✨pure dm ✨ and we would still have these little roadrunners in the pivot trying to put out fires we need a deep lying playmaker like jorginho to supplement that giant dm that way we still have a balance of physicality and tech in midfield 
thiago silva jorginho mount james in that order james and mount should be offered 8 year deals 
matic gt gt 
2 left lionel messi 
your penalty win formula is the dumbest thing i've seen this year 
rice has to be used properly maybe with a creative player beside him 
any midfield without our anchor ⚓ is a scam 
em see jorginho for em sleep 😂 
leave the standing triple jump to sports day ya dafty 
the club needs him there's something they call squad depth seems like it's only juve that's pursuing that level of depth first matic now jorginho 
one of jorginho kanté need to leave for tchouameni rice and this is so evident 
plus considering the fact that he's missed a whole lot of games due to injuries compared to the other midfielders 
awb cannot even bench azpil not to talk of james 
locatelli pogba rabiot with zakaria fagioli ranocchia mirreti as options possibilities jorginho and perisic 
you know with reece james playing as a rcb until the 60th minute against you with cesar as a rw 😂 chelsea threw that one no havertz rudiger jorginho kovacic silva either injured or benched 
debate on his position in the current system he can play as a 6 but we would need a very disciplined dm who screens the picture below depicts how the midfield could set up in possession and in pressing phases we’ve seen similar situations when jorginho and kante have played… https t co qrausmprin 
do a low budget signing to replace kepa if he leaves confident mendy will recapture his best form gks mendy kepa someone else cb's kounde silva garvidol trevor colwill wb fbs cucurella chilwell reece maehle cms rice kante jorginho kovacic gilmour ampadu 
moving to the center of the park it's my believe that not a lot of changes will happen minor players might leave to make space for players like gilmour ampadu the factor is jorginho here outs jorginho barkley rlc saul ins rice tchouameni extra if 5 leaves gilmour amp 
abegiiiii ndi okacha mara 
kante can’t do anything again not even tackle 
jorginho that guy go some spot kick blessings 
we’ve only lost 4 pl games when kovacic has started 2 being man city and the other 2 he came off injured in the first half the jorginho stat isn’t outrageous especially given he only started 1 vs city 
hazard jorginho drogba david luiz 
maybe replace jorginho with rovella might be a tad unrealistic economically 
i promise you gallagher is better than kovacic and jorginho pys is the same guy who said auoar is levels above mount and look where that got him 😂 
as i read reports the plan is for locatelli jorginho pogba midfield 
mendy azpilicueta chalobah rudiger james kante jorginho alonso ziyech mount lukaku they have already guanrenteed themselves a top 4 finish though now so they could rest more than we think i’d wait to be careful 
conor has a much higher ceiling than them 
missing 3 crucial pens in a row and scoring every single one for chelsea is embarrassing to a level i have never seen he’s also a liability against physical teams that play long ball and inshallah 
lukaku pulisic kenedy sarr unlikely due to how many cb’s are leaving kepa azpi alonso christensen free rudi free barkley bakayoko jorginho rlc kante a year left and can’t produce as well as before 
off the player that touched me i was begging the players to play it and that i was confident azpilicueta rushed and said jorginho would take it i sulked and walked out of the box jorginho took it and the keeper saved and i started throwing tantrums and shouting at jorginho 😂 
you don't know anything about awards details and alredy you proved that best player in the world 2021 lewa fifa the best winner best player in europe jorginho uefa the best france magazine winner pessi😂 https t co hdit3kln1z 
targeting those who know the league too well to tidy things we can go full out fr him next season when he's free and we are back to the ucl this is why i feel our best bet will be eriksen and probably jorginho eriksen will be like a nathan tadic for eth 
azpi christensen and alonso it’s probably time for them and club jorginho isn’t player to build around transferred for sarri to play sarriball and that’s past and gone kepa barkley rlc cho loan werner romelu puli ziyech… rebuild with how many 
there are just too many instances of players sitting out deals amp things taking too long amp having negative impact horrendous by marina 
sneijder wasn’t the star of that inter team nor was he the star of the dutch team if you think he deserved it then you also have no problem in admitting that jorginho deserved it in 2021 https t co qbcp5zkbzb 
chelsea v city 0 1 chelsea v arsenal 2 4 madrid v chelsea 2 3 liverpool v liverpool league cup chelsea v liverpool 2 2 a certain 23 yo started and played the full games i like jorginho though 
pogba locatelli will immediately be up there with the best in the league 
all the best as he returns to italy it's just inevitable 
damn i'll miss jorginho we don't deserve him anyways i hope we sign a good replacement 
we can sell kante to man utd or jorginho to juventus rlc to lazio keep kova and gallagher 
right foot hazard willian ronaldo milner jorginho left griezmann messi robben lukaku is a bit good 
underated cdm https t co wnfpwtgvwc 
balotelli ronaldo bruno fernandes jorginho harry kane left juan mata messi baines rvp these are my best penalty takers 
he missed important penalty that caused them wc he missed a pen again with chelsea last month i guess 
i'd take that midfield any day add to that fagioli who'll learn alot from the seniors and rovella and we have a good midfield rabiot can come on and be crap when matches are at 3 0 
i hope people realize ronaldo and messi are not special penalty takers they just have that fear factor special pk takers on my list • di natale • balotelli • jorginho • milner • few more 
i made list which i can decide to mention as many players as possible you can as well make your own list 
left messi salah mahrez robben rodriguez roberto carlos draw your conclusions 
azpi replacement alonso replacement christensen replacement rudiger replacement potentially a jorginho replacement and a serious winger https t co 9pthtovbqz 
ziyech will probably go unless there's a change in formation cho needs a loan kovacic is our best mid and one of the best mids itw and hopefully remains injury free next season he can and has before kante is done yes jorginho is good but the team doesn't 
werner is sus ziyech is injury prone cho plays well in installments kovavic again injury prone kante is finsihed jorginho purple patch is over havertz and mount the only good players left tbh correct me coz i might be wrong 
predicted line ups chelsea mendy azpilicueta chalobah rudiger james kante jorginho alonso ziyech mount lukaku leicester city schmeichel castagne fofana evans justin tielemans dewsbury hall albrighton maddison barnes vardy 
1 both are close to jorginho 2 rodri better than rice 
people like jorginho who wait for the keeper to move have a great technique on their hands but it’s also not foolproof 
3 4 3 formation will be continued • alonso rudiger christensen likely to leave jorginho might want to go back to italy and one of lukaku werner broja will be offloaded 1 2 https t co m4miuqzx34 
azpi missed 😏 kepa 2 great saves 🧤 hazard last taker 🔥 
lampard had limited role in transfer decision making but qualified top 4 with the youth team his signings then won chelsea the cl 
a central striker and 2 wing forwards just like under conte unless you think hazard was a no 10 no one uses no 10 nowadays mount is just a complete player unlike jorginho mount plays every game because he’s so good 
then we need some midfield player jorginho amp ruben inconsistency kante getting older kovacic is the only good midfield we had need to bring gallagher and gilmour home but it would be nice to sign rice in

around 22k if i’d captained richarlison or maddison 🤦🏻 you have a good gw 
clubs let players like dcl richarlison amp pickford down the last 12 months in terms of football they have every right to be unhappy 
richarlison is so humble i have no doubts he's gonna take a time to talk with you 
thoughts on the game season toss up between pickford and richy for player of the season both immense often with play and energy huge save by pickford with 2 1 and of course richarlison with the equalizer and commitment

romeu for southampton handball but no pen matip for liverpool foul but no pen vs brentford denied pen for shirt pull on richarlison vs brentford denied pen for shirt pull on rondon that’s not including any of the dodgy red card decisions 
what matters is the progress the club made in that period everton couldn't string two wins together the home crowd was quiet richarlison was underperforming and frank came along gotta love the work he's done

half of the squad should have been dropped into bramley moore dock before they started filling it in but jordan pickford anthony gordon richarlison and especially the fans deserve huge credit for dragging us through these last few weeks 💙💙 
should’ve done richarlison captain rather than ings the swing is enough to get me inside the top 100 k 😅 
pure useless players on such a big game 
further thinking aloud scenario one would defo see richarlison drop to bench after tonights result 
out lampard 
i just hope they don’t believe this form is sustainable under lampard the club has so much potential but so much work to do they need to nail their next managerial appointment particularly if dcl and richarlison look to leave graham potter is the dream 
fair play though what that shows is they are up for the fight with lampard in charge need to tighten up defense next year keep dcl and richarlison and we will be in a rekagation fight again next year 😂😂

richarlison saved his ass from relegation carrying this underperforming team week after week he is not even close to potter howe or viera your agenda is absurd 
richarlison man i don't know what to say about him has given absolutely everything to the club fitting that he got the tying goal that gave us a chance to win 
can add ings ©️ over richarlison to this list 
my wishlist for gw37 was 1 richarlison 2 watkins 3 zaha 
i genuinely see it as an incredibly dangerous thing to do imagine if it hit someone and they were burnt he could have been arrested but the prem didn’t have a problem very strange it went quiet so quick 
i rarely tweet here but i knew that everton would survive tonight i said this immediately the match started those waiting to laugh at lampard would really be disappointed ☹️ richarlison is really awesome great performance everton 💙💙 
apart from richarlison there is barely a player who can control a football at the moment if they lost him i honestly couldn’t see them getting over 30 points next year 
corruptfa 
this is going to take a lot of luck to seal my second place it's all down to one player richarlison how i hate him 
richarlison has kept them up with some big moments dcl winner was a header many strikers don’t score they’re both better than that 
like that is incredibly dangerous and i’m amazed nothing came from it 
thats the difference between 16k currently and 5 2k 
andddd richarlison ends with 5 shots 🤦‍♂️ 
if utd lose nunez then richarlison should be the main target 
richarlison i love individually but he works best in a transition side with space behind the dcl injury prone points are really false medically 
on the brightside they've got frank lampard 
strange take 
this is for every single one of you blues who stood up and made your voice heard to carry this team to safety you are the real heroes💙💙💙 efc coyb https t co hqgt1kxyds 
i think richarlison has actually had a quietly excellent season no one likes him but he is actually very very good 
and richarlison carried everton these last few weeks what a player 
great goals from keane richarlison and dominic calvert lewin ⚽️ dele alli changed the game for me 👏👏 it's not just a game it's our life 🔵 🔵 evecry 🦅 efc coyb everton utft goodison 💙 
jesus a smokescreen for richarlison oh lawd 
that shut the liverpool fans up who will be crying on sunday 😆 
the attacking game plan is basically the same as rafa's no real structure just hope dcl and richarlison do something with odd bit of help from the others and the defending is still shite 
what was intentional was richarlison’s pathetic little kick at henderson the other week another ref may well have sent him off so you got away with another there he scored the next game 
fact that richarlison even scored i dislike that guy smh 
united should go for richarlison

or maybe just admit you’re a muppet… 
if we do go down it won't only be because of this incident 
the foul committed at the other end had to be a red he was the last man and the attacker was through on goal wether it was incidental or not the letter of the law is that's a red 
appalling performance 
i understand that richarlison is very eccentric but him being involved in so many poor decisions solely by coincidence seems strange 
but whatever stats from fbref 
mo salah has the most touches in the epl in the opposition box and it's by a lot 323 to 243 mane funny enough richarlison has 140 and gordon 81 gordon amp salah have both won 2 pks 
richarlison gets criticised for going to ground as it is a foul is a foul a penalty is a penalty and if it was given as it shouldve been then the red card is rescinded 
man are talking about nuñez and richarlison i’m not hearing it ooo pls keep it far away 
that was the only difference the foul itself was a stonewall red 
really enjoyed todays game to be fair enjoyed the eriksen master class 
iwobi already tracked back which was brilliant and he would have left richarlison upfront alone who can waste time by making them commit and slowing tempo 
then immediately gives a red for an incident which happens 60 yards away from him 🤷🏽‍♂️

may i ask a question was the final minute richarlison shot on target 
if richarlison didn’t throw himself to the floor more often he may have had a chance penalty was a simple foul clumsy and not through on goal and not a goal scoring opportunity for me not a yellow but yep i they have been given in the past

yet richarlison has his shirt practically removed by ajer and no official including var notices absolute joke var needs to be scrapped 
thought you said “dive by” i was going to suggest to you asked richarlison for tips or gordon… …or carthorse lewin… 
because we're everton and the 
halftime thoughts it’s just never easy for everton is it the blues got off to a perfect start with that calvert lewin goal but then it all goes wrong with young branthwaite sent off and the own goal richarlison has given the blues life again though efc evebre 
just got to 🤣🤣🤣 at this point i've never seen anything like it 
you'd love him if he played for you makes yp for the blatant pen we were denied earlier that led to the red 
no doubt frank is giving him a pat on the back for his cleverness at this very moment 👍🏿 
richarlison a true leader utft 
that's a foul penalty so he should have been asked to retake that still what do you expect from richarlison when he spends half the game on the floor pretending to have been murdered he is an embarrassment to the game

my oohhh my what a dramatic half of football penalty for everton richarlison to take it 
oliver like pawson is really poor 
richarlison to take 1 1 efc brentfordfc evebre pl 
1 1 efc brentfordfc evebre pl 
sorenson brings down richarlison he's already been booked doesn't get a second yellow 
i think it should be a pen and i‘m a liverpool fan 
people keep saying that richarlison was also pulling ajer's shirt but i've not seen an angle where he's doing any more than touching the shoulder 
and yes richarlison is also that kind of player 
i should clarify in my opinion there is foul on richarlison it's oliver's view that there wasn't happy to try and understand why he thought that not every pull of the shirt results in a foul i'd have given it still it has nothing to do with how everton defended the break 
1 0 efc brentfordfc evebre pl 
richarlison is a cheat and a diver 
richarlison deserved a penalty as well that was a full on shirt grab they give penalties for far less 
anyhow we're back underway 1 0 efc brentfordfc evebre pl 
i captained richarlison too 🤪 
refereeing is a joke clear foul on richarlison before toney dive 
foul given against holgate for a shirt pull about five minutes earlier too but when richarlison almost has his ripped off in the box… 
hurt me some 7 8 points there despite richarlison assist 
there is a foul on richarlison but that doesn't excuse how poorly set up they were to defend a long clearance it was so bad 
sorry oliver is incompetent dishonest and like dean and moss surely should resign 
shut it or get a cucumber 🥒 up your bum let's have it my son not scored half season then you poach a goal you slag 
also richarlison is often criticised for going to ground too easily notice what happens when he stays on his feet we get fucked over by the refs it’s a fucking disgrace 
he has somehow managed to stay close to brentford despite richarlison’s transfer fee dramatically exceeding brentford’s 5 year net spend unreal achievement 
play should have been taken back and red card also taken back 
i could say why wasnt it a foul for brentford because richarlison was pulling ajers shirt bit i can see what happened without bias 
after a few replays it looks harsh doesn’t it also it’s almost certainly a penalty at the other end for the shirt pulling on richarlison isn’t it evebre 
looks like theres more of a foul on richarlison than on toney i’d be furious as an everton fan evebre 
especially after the 2 bullshit pens we've seen spurs gifted with the last 2 games something stinks 
i’ve captained him give me a break its been an awful season 😂😭

ajer had a bit of richarlison's shirt in brentford's box and everton appealed for the penalty seconds later and branthwaite is off game has completely changed 
it did look a clear shirt pull on richarlison 1 0 efc brentfordfc evebre pl 
that’s not a pen for richarlison either they’re grappling each other braithwaite walks this is good for us 
brentford clear toney chases and is brought down by branthwaite red card given by michael oliver 1 0 efc brentfordfc evebre pl 
richarlison's shirt genuinely nearly gets pulled off his back how is that not a penalty

trying to pick my captain on fh right now and really not sure i don't trust anyone in my team ings richarlison zaha or maddison from the dgwers or son 
fully expect to be regretting the captain choice but be a happy palace fan at the end of the gw haha

not a fan of double defence on single gw players in a double rather have anderson start over coady diaz to much of a rotation risk i would rather have jota in i can't see tsimikas outscoring anyone in your team besides ait nouri so probably ok on bench

£7 6 richarlison has been inconsistent but has managed returns in 4 of 7 eve need to win both to feel safe since ars in gw38 will mean a ton to them dgw and while both bre and cry have shown to be decent defensively richarlison usually only needs one chance to make it count 
richarlison is a good option too 
i think pepi’s reported fee around €20m would put him in like top 30 of brazilian exports players like bruno guimarães and renan lodi moved for similar fees richarlison moved for considerably less it’s crazy 
i think the multitude of captain options is what is confusing i can see arguments for son kdb ings zaha and richarlison i think i prefer son but he's got one game in a double and it's the first one i just can't decide i think i'll probably go kdb so is a hit worth it 
can't decide

roberto firmino firmino’s moved from hoffenheim to liverpool in 2015 firmino’s start to life in merseyside proved underwhelming but the arrival of jurgen klopp – a manager familiar with his talents from the bundesliga – proved the catalyst for an upturn in fortunes https t co 5rhupyevpa 
if the reds score twice they will record 550 goals in the league under jürgen klopp and also hit the landmark of 250 in away league games roberto firmino requires just two goals to become the 19th liverpool player to reach 100 across all competitions

bit of a break here as cornet gets treatment spurs have been enjoying a bit more possession recently but there's a bit of frustration now burnley digging in in their 5 3 2 nathan collins heading everything away does conte try an unfit kulusevski at ht how about bergwijn 
nathan collins striding forward and playing cornet through it really should be 0 1 burnley but lloris saves collins has been outstanding so far
