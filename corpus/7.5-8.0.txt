a friend reminder gabriel magalhaes outscored sancho in all competitions this season with 5 lesser games 😭😭 
well just wanted to clarify that gabriel magalhães have got more goals than this bum this season 
more from sancho while gabriel magalhaes has more goals than him 😂😂😂 
partey was in ucl playing club too so was gabriel magalhaes gabriel jesus is also currently in a ucl team but arsenal are still favourites to land him nothing is impossible 
poor decision making dropped gabriel magalhāes target and lloris the guys scored 16 points 🤔😪😪😪😪 
also gabriel magalhaes has as many pl goals as any of our strikers 
gabriel magalhaes is good in pl we bought him from lille 
goal they have a 4th another poor bit of defending from everton on a corner allows gabriel magalhães loose in the penalty are and he lashes home arsenal's fourth 🔴⚪️ 4 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
martin ødegaard 🪄 appearances 36 goals 7 assists 4 goals per match 0 2 minutes per goal 399 shots 53 shots on target 21 shooting accuracy 63 6 goals with right foot 1 goals with left foot 5 goals from inside the box 5 1 2 
i remember you saying martin ødegaard will shine back in the days what a baller he is top gun 
🇳🇴 martin ødegaard 8 10 people will say he doesn't get enough g a but just watch him and say he ins't a joy to watch he was slow to get going but him and saka have carried us through this 2nd half of the season easily could be captain next year huge part of the future 
arteta loves martin ødegaard so much he made his son wear one too

thank you for the news this season dominic calvert lewin to arsenal 
other possible outgoings andre gomes dele alli richarlison please no dominic calvert lewin please no 
goal poor defending as usual from arsenal and everton have a route back in dominic calvert lewin plays the ball across the penalty area and donny van de beek is there to turn it home 🔴⚪️ 2 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
alex iwobi manages to get the ball into the arsenal penalty area which is very well dummies by dominic calvert lewin but demari gray fires well over 🔴⚪️ 2 0 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
still he should play elsewhere we need a new strike force my pick would be gabriel jesus amp dominic calvert lewin 
if dominic nathaniel calvert lewin is auditioning for the gunners today i'd say he's passing 
dominic calvert lewin's nipple should do the trick 
i think dominic calvert lewin is a fantastic striker who can actually do a job at real madrid him and ancelotti have worked well at everton 
donny van de beek needs to replace this stat padding idiot bruno can't dribble can't pass can't dictate tempo literally usless and overrated 
congratulations donny van de beek on scoring today well done 😉👌 all enjoy your time off 💜 
our spend is a million miles off yours and you imply our season has been average 🙄🙄i'll bet you're looking forward to second rate signings in the transfer window worthy of your position in the league 😂😂is donny van de beek coming back 😂😂😂😂😂😜😜😜

best team 🥇 man city with the crazy comeback to win the league worst team 🗑 norwich didn't look interested all game fav moment 🙌🏻 jack harrison's goal celebrations to keep leeds up 
and it was a former city boy who made sure in jack harrison 
great goal today jack we're so happy we won 
you need to believe in yourself more jack you are a superstar and potentially can up there with the best in the world be more positive and forget about it when you make a mistake you have the best touch in the prem wand of left foot and will run all day well done 
jack harrison's 94th minute winner 
and how about jack harrison scoring leeds out of relegation in extra time 
incredible performance well done jack 
jack scored a hat trick the day after marcelo sent me this like to think of mb somewhere with a smile on his face after today had a sneaky chat with the shirt before today's game think the spirit of mb will always live on in leeds 
rodrigo in his pants with jack harrison 
thank you jack what a relief mot 
arise sir jack 
listen up if by the 94 minute when jack harrison saved your arse you hadn't worked out that your january gamble had backfired then you've got about four weeks to get a grip of your management team and sign half a dozen players otherwise it's ⤵️

jack harrison scored in 94th to clinch it they could've still gone down had burnley found an equalizer 
and ironically nycfc old player jack harrison scored the goal in the 94' to keep them up lol

jack harrison underrated player last season ran like a dog no injury 16 g a and scored a hatty on bowens yard earlier this season 
because he's been passing the ball to the same player as jack harrison 
because that's one more than jack harrison this year he has 3 one less than dan james 
ha i promise you it was my brother who is not jack harrison 
he played with a great bamford last season and got 1 assist more than jack harrison there is no high reward 
joe the only person i can imagine saying this is jack harrison 
is that jack harrison bottom right 
come on jack lad let's get at them we can win this and stay up believe mot 
phyllis is a phony unlike her daughter nu summer phyllis probably doesn't care that ash lied to innocent little harrison about dying so she'd probably encourage an ash diane ship to keep diane away from jack

and declan rice could slot in right there behind fred… 
rather sign declan rice 
real head on chumney or pay for declan rice and you need another strong defender good job 
soucek had a poor season due to declan rice sorry but it is a fact europe is secured still a great season great europa cup run carabao run and decent league run with a thin roster onto next season coyi 
i think you'll be more ambitious this time they won't want another season like this one that was way too close for comfort if the owners show some ambition i think phillips will stay it also depends on what happens with declan rice too as he's a very similar player 🤷‍♂️ 
facts imagine a guy like declan rice playing in a midfield with a guy like pedri and gavi would be the greatest disaster 
was thinking of you won't be able to see declan rice when the train goes past at 6 in the conference league 
i want united to sell rashford mctominay and maguire so we can buy declan rice with that money 
if i wanted clicks i would be a mount stan or declan rice stan account so shut up 
bt sport owner here watched most of marseilles games this year kamara is excellent he overplays a little but is strong as an ox if i would liken him to an english player it would be declan rice 
declan rice is not a striker get a proper striker 
oh it's that guy he said jorginho is shit and declan rice is clear 
it is undeniable that losing declan rice this summer could be a massive blow for west ham but with moyes in charge i think hammers should feel confident that they could survive and keep building towards a long term goal he's 100 the right man for the job 
declan rice 🤮 
coz they preferred to wait for declan rice 🤦🏽‍♂️ 
majority of fans booed him because he would have walked into the scotland team at the time same way ireland fans abused declan rice and jack grealish after they snubbed ireland to play for england using your logic the irish fans are racist too 
jules kounde and declan rice hopefully 
declan rice cuccerella and two cb's i guess 
declan rice 
who said anything about declan rice or kante kamara who's going to villa on a free bissouma etc it's not hard people just afraid of change and to move on from the guy despite never helping us make ucl 
gotta be declan rice 
phil foden and declan rice get a mention but no room for the joint golden boot winner 
this was same way rufai oseni tried to speak about declan rice yesterday and ended up goofing who quotes £25 million for a player of rice's quality ya'a should stick to news and journalism and leave football for us abeg🙏 
he is the best dm in the pl now🔥 clear of fabinho kante amp declan rice 
please join declan rice at westham 🤞 
clear what agenda he is pushing here but surely mentioning hibs adds holes in that argument also has he not heard of declan rice or jack grealish 🥴🥴🥴 
true that declan rice carries that team no wonder they are desperate to keep him 
xhaka out of arsenal guy are you high on something hw much do you think a very good defense mf will cost now in modern market declan rice n kante 
canners not long before we add declan rice to the flag 🔵 
our manager needs declan rice apart from new cbs 
hope things get better for you personally in the end the game demands an unhealthy amount of attention and it's not as big as the other things more precious in life take care and enjoy the break thank you for giving us declan rice ahd sofies donald duck duet ✌️ 🧡 
declan rice just a placeholder for brenden aaronson next season 
get declan rice and an eriksen type of midfielder and we switch to a back 4 that will get us the league 
all i'm saying is that declan rice and jack grealish ditched the aul country and look at them now think about it 
declan rice is phenomenal end of story 
declan rice 
you rated him good enough for your team 👍🏻 better than declan rice according to yourself sounds like sour grapes 
declan rice one of them hopefully 👍🏽 
spammers y do u even think u r on our level u have and never will finish above us just lucky u have declan rice as love him spursarmy 
when it's august 29th and we start monitoring declan rice 
conor gallagher conor fucking gallagher💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀not to mention declan rice wtf it's clearly biased towards english princesses the prem can't stand the fact that their best players aren't english and they never have been will be 
their season was a success again and they're very unlucky not to be in the europa league but should still consider this a great season going into the el that far is remarkable and they should go for the uecl next season 💪🏻 lets see what happens with declan rice👀 
would have been nice to try and win today with ten hag watching and the wages these average players get paid time for clear out to start declan rice or philips a must 
he answered it he played with ireland from under 14s fair enough unlike declan rice changing jack grealish changing just because another country came calling at least he stuck to what he started with 
then he needs to sign declan rice simple 
…today's result must of hit declan rice hard what attraction is the conference league nothing he might have a great relationship with moyes …but doubts must be settling not about about money it's about ambition he knows that we have… 
honestly it will not be easy for chelsea next season especially losing alonso rudiger christensen and azpilicueta they need massive recruitment to level up and compete hopefully they don't waste their transfer budget on declan rice 
declan rice has been my young player all season 
declan rice🤣 
declan rice was also dreadful vs brighton today but that's your mctominay replacement 
i presume declan rice will go if only because he'd significantly improve a lot of bigger teams than west ham 
declan rice 
french players are all the same just go for a declan rice of joao palhinha 
i can only assume you are not a football fan you targeted declan rice one of the best english players in the country one of the best holding midfielders in world football 
it's my opinion i watch both teams and mount just goes missing in games personally i would have given it to declan rice 
maybe when we have declan rice in midfielder puli will score 25 goals 
at a good price no need to buy these overrated english players like declan rice 
pieface lando norris declan rice mark noble 
people that want to buy declan rice lol we are not a serious club plus the new owners may not be ones to spend 
declan rice on there is a j o k e 
we're too soft we have been for years we keep changing the back line around but ultimately they have zero cover from the midfield we're crying out for a midfield enforcer such as declan rice who can protect that back four 
we need bissouma he is more hardworking than declan rice 
good lad heard isaac is a big declan rice fan 
now buy declan rice 
maybe i'm waxing lyrical here but i think he's like the declan rice of france he's not as well acclaimed and hyped as some youngsters but i genuinely struggle to think of a time he's had bad form 
i know it's an old chant but i think 🎶he's here he's there he's every fucking where declan rice declan rice is a perfect chant for him 
phillips can team up with declan rice at manure next season 
• england home kit declan rice 
declan rice would have scored an own goal from there 
declan rice easily wins award followed by connor gallagher 
declan rice has completed the most passes for west ham in the premier league this season with 1882 however his 90 5 competition rate is bettered by manuel lanzini with 90 8 
outfield declan rice jarrod bowen michail antonio and pablo fornals all start for west ham this afternoon making their 36th premier league appearance of the season rice has the most starts with 34 the others with 33 starts rice also with most minutes played 3 089 
should've been declan rice 
declan rice 
that was a huge gamble on their part paid off in the end but a gamble all the same standing your ground is west ham and declan rice psg turned the deal down hoping they could still sway him the president called this guy money won this time it's that simple imo 
declan rice to manchester united who says no 
and we're gonna miss out on sangare to liverpool probably so that's three top class cdms we just let walk to prem rivals probably means we're gonna start crying for declan rice get out of my sight 
declan rice 💯💯 
jarrod bowen to score and declan rice yellow card 
we dont need another 5 foot tiny midfielder prem has become too physical need players like tchoumeni pogba declan rice 
declan rice both 
how tf is declan even the last on this list mehnn rice's only contender should be rodri tf is hojberg above rice this list is shit tho 
ivan toney amp declan rice 
currently declan rice 
declan rice 
declan rice 
i can't stand declan rice 
they'll revise history and say it was declan rice the 5 during this time all along 
declan rice will do too 
declan rice 🤨 
have drawn up a shortlist of central defensive midfielders considered a recent problem area and jorginho expected to join declan rice tops the list but tchouameni and yves bissouma also on the list 
you have attacked grealish and declan rice now name 1 midfielder that worth 100m 
declan rice 
mason mount should keep the number 19 however reece number 2 ben chilwell number 3 and declan rice number 4 
haaland around 60m is fkn steal couldn't get any better hell even declan rice costs 150m right now 
they are all rice cos rice is the surname family name not declan so there is no beans stew nor ponmo 😜 
declan rice is too expensive good but too expensive 
double trekkers right there a tackle declan rice would be proud of 
if it's not jermaine jenas i'll be shocked declan rice will be the next after him 
i just randomly remembered when declan rice sang ice ice baby and you had a donald duck duet 😂😂😂😂❤️ 
declan rice then bring hazard back on loan instead of neymar 👀👀 
declan rice also after the semi final loss 
declan rice is an amazing player 
what relevance does that have chilwell amp mount do modelling all the time amp declan rice if he comes back to us 
everyone needs to keep their heads a dm 2 cbs a lwb and maybe a forward player who fits the formation tt wants are the priorities the only superstar signing needed is declan rice 
fucking hell i was waiting for it the triple whammy cobhamsexuals jorginho and declan rice all in 1 tweet lol 
no it was in his interest to join us the first time to get in the england squad and then he turned his back on us let's move on to someone young and hungry to play for us in the declan rice mould like calvin bassey 
over declan rice too 
no ben he wasn't conor gallagher crystal palace mohamed salah liverpool trent alexander arnold liverpool kevin de bruyne manchester city phil foden manchester city declan rice west ham 
conor gallagher declan rice foden no son any wonder we feel there is an agenda 
declan rice 
i read the comments and i have come to a conclusion salah is the the most hated and underrated player in the world right now imagine if declan rice had salah output the media would know no other name as long as it's not voting salah would win what he can total bias uno 
declan rice foden and gallagher are not top 10 where's ronaldo son cancelo mase 
definitely ousmane dembele he fits the bill perfectly considering the fact that chelsea don't create nearly enough chances he's the perfect signing cuz we'll get him for free and what's more we know for a fact he'll perform so all this i'm hearing about declan rice is shit 
declan rice harry kane and eden hazard 
de jong joining reminds me of when di maria joined kicked out of a big club comes without actually wanting to come shit goes south quickly i'm not comfortable feel we need people who actually want to be around would love declan rice feel he can bring proper control to mid 
i know it should've been declan rice or bowen disgrace really 
sign declan rice 
declan rice for partey i reckon 
kdb is head and shoulders the best player in the league there is no doubt for me that anyone else should have won it the one i find difficult is foden getting young player that was declan rice for me 
take declan rice 
declan rice by a country mile future chelsea and england skipper 
he's like alex goldberg he thinks declan rice gonna get pulisic on 20 goals and 20 assists 
declan rice play for west ham united 😂😂😂😂 
i think kdb has pulled city along at times i never understand awards until the end of the season it could be either or someone else why not declan rice for example same shit different day 
but he is english so you see look what they are doing to declan rice now 🤦‍♂️ 
salah until afcon kdb after recovering from injury son has been consistent bowen all season ⚒️ coyis 👍 declan rice but i'm being bias 😆⚒️ 
i would go with declan rice 
declan rice should win 
greenwood needs a payrise😂😂 rashford joins look at declan rice £150 000 000 kanté was £36 000 000 lol i personally don't rate those english boys😂 brazilians runs this game 
what about declan rice 
all that they want is declan rice amp mount pics to jack off too they don't have the best interest of the club in mind 
declan rice isn't even in the top 30 best players in the league let alone top 3 
problem is you have to be young' declan rice has got to be at least 32 by now 
you know nothing about football and no west ham thinks that of declan rice not one i was there watching him develop you weren't you're lying 
lol how to show you haven't watched declan rice play 
pie face as the return best guest would be mr beast declan rice would be awesome and very achievable 
deep holding midfielder is that we wanted so declan rice or bissouma 
was trying to buy nkunku and declan rice their individual prices are more than the budget 😭 so ended up buying kamara and tchouameni 
the premier league is all about robbery… mason mount did better than foden this season there's arnold declan rice even saka but the foden hype gets him everything without even working hard 
declan rice for sure 
ban declan rice face too ugly 
you've obviously never heard of declan rice 
harry kane or declan rice 
this is easy declan rice amp darwin nunez 🤞🏻 
declan rice 
hey alex just curious if you could make the decision what's the max amount of money you will pay to west ham to get declan rice at chelsea 
maybe he's too good for the championship matt targett will be available too 
i always knew matt targets time was up since grealish left every fullback when the winger is given time to have the ball and carry it will succeed hence why targett looked so good 
lad targett literally said all of this himself😂 
how did matt targett get a bonus point today ahead of maximim 
you're talking bollocks it's form amp performances that get you picked targett has been solid every game for us amp formed a great partnership with burn we have other leftbacks which matt has kept out of the team he's not bottled anything amp made it obvious he wants to stay 
you make matt targett look like a netball player 👏👏👏 
matt targett is a geordie see you next season you hero 🖤🤍🖤🤍 
matt targett 
matt targett… we want you to stay… what a player… u have to stay with us ⚫️⚪️⚫️⚪️ 
matt targett 
form wise i agree but it takes more than that to establish yourself as a team if we're still holding them ransom over matt targett then we're doing better 
been a great end to the season btw cheers for matt targett this lad had been great for us consistently good at left back makes up for losing out on digne 
joelinton bruno everton leeds away matt targett 
matt targett 
yeah mate we've got the matt targett finished higher than villa cup presentation next week come along 
matt targett 
matt targett wow 
coutinho and kamara signed you're praying you get matt targett 
we've signed coutinho and kamara you're praying you sign matt targett this summer 
matt targett yaknow 😭 
matt targett deserves keys to the city for you lot 
we were awful most of that game had so much chances on the counter and we just messed with awful desicions and touches however great defensive resilience especially the matt targett head of the the line 
digne showing how much of an upgrade he will be next season on matt targett with a pre season he could be a huge asset for us 
he's no matt targett 
we literally employed matt targett until january 
matt targett and nick pope both to be carded today 
matt targett and nick pope both to be carded today

matt targett morgan sanson bertrand traore anwar el ghazi trezeguet and kortney hause are likely to be available this summer villa do not anticipate any major departures mcginn and watkins have admirers but are regarded as key players in gerrard's revolution avfc 
i'd sell maitland niles for a decent fee torreira's career is over here not good enough for pl level always been a star in serie a that's one position arsenal need strengthening wish we landed bruno guimaraes he's a monster of a midfielder 
so we're not including bruno guimaraes' flick v southampton in the goal of the season list i guess we had to make room for mo salah somehow another puskas winner there🙄 
bruno guimaraes not in contention a joke surely 
1️⃣1️⃣ newcastle • 49pts no team has faced a bigger change than the magpies this season they are now the richest club in the world and have started to build towards premier league success bruno guimaraes and eddie howe deserve huge credit for the club's incredible turnaround 
the whole league should be worried about newcastle but again that's another rival you think bruno guimarães even considers newcastle i think newcastle could potentially beat that leicester west ham bracket 
bruno guimarães has only just started his pl journey give him some time 
not excited not heart broken could we have achieved more yes have we improved yes i worry is i have no confidence in edu sadly i won't forgive him for bottling bruno guimarães deal that was the easiest transfer job yet edu played and still has a good relationship with lyon 
now the season is over interested to hear people's… 👇🏼 player of the season kevin de bruyne young player konate 22 best signing guimaraes worst signing weghorst breakout player jose sa flop bruno fernandes manager of the season eddie howe 
all na still money bruno guimaraes was key he was not cheap kieran trippier was also a handy purchase even howe would not have taken the job if he did not have assurance of being backed 
bruno guimaraes aswell it felt like he won 30 duels 
man i swear bruno guimaraes is the only bruno in the pl which i actually like 
no it's not bruno guimaraes there is absolutely no way one can say he would have not improved us 
bruno guimaraes ball does move me 
🔒 locked gw38 team reveal 🔒 c luis diaz v bruno guimaraes 🔄 free hit played 0 
we already seeing how bruno guimaraes is playing at newcastle this was a free transfer in a position we need 2 desperately hoping this isnt a regretful miss window 
it's not just us though bruno guimarães wanted by arsenal and he goes to new castle it's madness villa brighton leicester palace newcastle and wolves are they more of an attraction to players than united and arsenal it's embarrassing imo 
he always played as number 8 in brazil only in europe every box to box player from brazil turn a cdm for example bruno guimaraes played as cdm in his first games in france 
no way bottom half epl clubs are signing cdm's likes bruno guimarães and kamara 
would signing bruno guimaraes of meant 4th for either united or arsenal had they gone in for him in jan 
ppl said the same about bruno guimaraes the only reason is that they're untested in the pl that's it 
do you know where bruno guimaraes would be

sots signing of the season bruno guimaraes newcastle the first marquee signing of the saudi era he has already endeared himself to the newcastle faithful and transformed the geordie team blessed with defensive playmaking and goalscoring qualities bruno might be a bargain 
leicester h newcastle united 2 1 leicester city bruno fucking guimaraes 😍😍😍 
lucas paqueta has turned down a move to newcastle united despite wanting to reunite with bruno guimaraes the reason is following a trip to the newcastle training ground his agent has informed me he was very disappointed with the state of the facilities 
bruno guimaraes with 10 seconds on the clock 
my guy bruno guimaraes 😎 
it's not so much of not wanting him is he the profile we should be after we need a bruno guimarães type player for the lcm position and depth for partey with torreria coming back i think he could provide the depth tchouameni is perfect unfortunately without ucl its impossible 
i don't ever really buy into this 'unknown foreigner' talk some of our best signings ever were just that brede hangeland dempsey steed malbranque joa andersen as you well know bruno guimaraes isn't half bad despite his lack of proven pl experience 
i wouldn't throw shade to the ligue 1 it has produced very good players e g bruno guimarães but the thing with guendouzi is that he has a diva attitude which arteta didn't like it probably suits sampaoli's ideal dressing room so good luck to him down there 
i don't think realistically there's a good enough replacement available to replace him atm there is tielemans but he's not good defensively tbh i think the player that would of upgraded upon him massively was bruno guimarães unfortunately 
don't even think newcastle will be in for him now in fairness maybe before bruno guimarães but now they look destined to sign his best mate paquetá from lyon 
do you support new castle bc of bruno guimaraes 
newcastle have more status than arsenal lol ur deluded mate have a day off bruno guimaraes is not haaland he was twerking for us and we didn't make the move hence the digs at us in the newcastle announcement video 
mount is in no way captain material you don't just give the armband to someone cause they bleed blue or cause he's proper chels reece on the other hand is a growing leader and also leads by example after thiago silva leaves we'll need to sign more leaders icl 
thiago silva and reece james captain and vice captain 
allison thiago silva de brunye thiago alcāntara cr7 thomas tuchel alonso maguire man utd and arsenal dragging this one😖😖 
thiago silva 2 0 akh he's winning that cl ring somewhere 
thiago hasn't played enough games i would put b silva instead 
think fabio would be a good signing similar to silva and thiago from what i've heard laimer or tchouameni would be good in the fabinho role you've also got carvalho as well then i think we go for a striker and a right back

factos😂the lady is a great signing alongside thiago silva 
decent season not a great season you're just saying the same thing he's been average he just looks good because the rest of the attackers have been poor reece james and thiago silva are the best players in this team 
i'm going unrealistic btw mendy kounde thiago silva gvardiol reece kova rice chilly mount neymar kai 
jesus i went and previewed got thiago silva and decent consumables bought it next preview 😮

thiago silva robbed 
thiago silva has never played played in a back 3 all his life yet he is still one of the best out there oga chelsea should sign explosive wingers and see tuchel outclass his opponents 
lies cafu played with maldini till very late in his carrer thiago silva today too 
congratulations to mount i voted for thiago silva 
give it to thiago silva 
thiago silva robbed 
give that to thiago silva 
reece james kai havertz thiago silva robbed 
thiago silva got robbed 
i think thiago silva deserves it more 
almost every match chelsea fans sang oh thiago silva how did this man not win that award robbery 
thiago silva on a free is pushing this group i think one more season like this one and hes there 
massive decline at chelsea man thiago silva deserves this more 
nope but thiago silva 
i thought thiago silva deserves this awards 
jorginho has given us one good half season in his entire time at chelsea he's been underwhelming along with most of our players this season while mount has been our top scorer and assist provider only thiago silva comes close for influence this season what's the problem 
we're not lfc guy we have the youngest team we need proven winners with winning mentality and fight why did liverpool buy milner why did chelsea buy thiago silva 
player thiago silva score 86 100 clearly our best and most consistent player this season it's sad that he won't get the credit due to being a cb but you are simply unreal thiago don't know where we would have been without you 
well he was my pick after thiago silva so yah he probably deserves it he's had an outstanding season to be fair to him 
critiqueing mount is fine but to say he ain't good enough is funny considering the other attackers we employ but to answer you just for the fun of it thiago silva reece james mendy and kante and mount are the only players who are 100 good enough to win the prem with imo 
we dropped points in 10 games 4 of the 10 really are expected 2 draws vs city gave neither team advantage 2 draws vs spurs city lost both 2 points gained the other 6 had 1 common variable missing thiago when kdb was struggling gundo amp b silva stepped up 
exactly if only such a talented young lad him and kounde with thiago silva would have been a nightmare for any team ugh 
almost signed off with an og but ohhhhhh thiago silva 
not thiago silva 
thanks man amazing season thanks for letting tomori come to milan😂😂 he has been best defender at milan after thiago silva 
yeah i'd agree with james although he was injured for the better part of the season i'm not denying mount's minerals o i like him thiago silva deserved it more 
thiago silva robbed but congrats to mount on a fantastic season still 💙 
thiago silva fully deserved it id even say rudi did but definitely not mount stat padding against bottom teams this whole season 
nah he has said well done mason sometimes too but mason didnt deserve it more than thiago silva or rudi 
i mean i'm basically saying goodbye to all my favourite players from home bar thiago silva reece james and mount but yeah not bottling it on the last day to you bunch of cunts was nice 😂💙 can not wait to see the bitch fit 😂 
also just remembered leonardo literally ran thiago silva out gave some poor players contract extensions with salary increases amp who was the reason for tuchel getting sacked 
it's obvious he was going to win it for a long time now we knew it was btw him and thiago silva still doesnt change the fact that we need better players even in his position on the pitch simply because the standard set by liverpool and city is way too high 
no its not about ppl thinking he is hazard its about ppl hyping him up like he is someone of hazards stature or quality i think thiago silva or a rudiger deserved more but thats my opinion he plays like our creator bro not a cm armin is criticising the selection and fans 
i voted for silva actually mount has a good shout for it too would love us to win the league title next season so thiago can leave with at least winning one with us 
city have a midfield of rodri gundogan de bruyne and silva hard to compete against them with the likes of keita jones milner and henderson thiago is the ideal midfielder but he's injury prone the midfield needs a massive upgrade for us to have a chance next season 
congratulations mount i voted for thiago silva to win because i believe he deserved it nonetheless i am sure others think otherwise 
he was still our best player alongside thiago silva that's not his fault other players didn't play better than him 
thiago silva was clear 
thiago silva should have won but it's all good mase also deserves it we push for the title next season come on chels💙💙💙 
thiago silva is our best defender rn it's not ideal to build around him but when all of targets rn are not on the level of him and losing 3 other cbs we need to build around him for at least next season we also do not have abromovic money we do not know how much we can spend 
should have been this thiago silva besides he missed the pen that caused us the fa cup 
not thiago silva tho 🤔 
100 a chelsea legend great leader rolls royce of a footballer still at 37 actions amp professionalism set the tone amp set a great example for younger players so proud thiago silva is part of chelsea forever 
i voted for mount coz he just lives in my head bias for him but at the time of voting it was just between thiago and mount anyways silva 💙💙what a man 
no i voted for thiago silva 
thiago silva imo but rest spot on 
top 5 chelsea player maybe but the best lots of thoughts needed for that personally my chelsea player would've gone for thiago silva especially how great he has been this season people will use real madrid as a factor against him but come on it was benzema that's hard 
thiago silva without back 3 tax is btech lindelof 😭 
thiago silva mount has ghosted us in very important matches it's not by g a 
have fun with rudiger thiago silva is our best defender btw 
mount was very good but thiago deserved it more even today silva saved us from humiliation saved own goal 
we are looking in every direction i think the structure suits our players well not only rudiger and christensen but thiago silva our midfielders and ben chilwell and reece james 
literally took all your defenders and left washed thiago silva 💀 
the last time milan won the scudetto zlatan and thiago silva won it together 
the last time it happened we had a milan team comprising of nesta thiago silva pirlo seedorf gattuso inzaghi cassano ambrosini only ibra is the sole member to still end up here 11 years later 
him and thiago silva of course my point is he has played way more games than the rest and he is similar to them in terms of ability but for sure there would be more hype around him from the english media and fans so here we are 1 2 
thiago silva was out motm almost every game for 2 months after november… 
the last time milan won the scudetto zlatan and thiago silva won it together 
the last time milan won the scudetto zlatan and thiago silva won it together 
congratulations mount even though we all thought thiago silva deserved that 
thiago silva well deserved … mason mount also well deserved 
that he's the best player this season right yep it was pretty darn obvious 😎 though i think thiago silva also deserved it a lot tough luck credit to him too 
for real i like mount but thiago silva deserves it more 
kova vs liverpool mount 4 0 juventus thiago silva contract extension 
tuchel on changing his formation next season i don't see it as a problem of structure it suits our players like ben chilwell thiago silva and reece james adding he doesn't need to change it but might be forced to depending on how his squad looks cfc chewat 
not frank's type of centre half mina very much in that mould that's why frank took thiago silva to chelsea likes ball players not yard dogs like tarkowski off to leeds or southampton 
statpadded against relegation fodder and cost us 2 trophies thiago silva was robbed 
need signings that fit a back 4 james and chilwell are fullbacks thiago silva shouldn't play much next season so we should definitely be looking at changing it 
robbed thiago silva but congrats anyway 
got good numbers contributes all over the pitch and he gives everything for the shirt my vote actually went to thiago silva but i have absolute no issues with mount winning and nor should any right minded fan any team would be lucky to have him and every manager says as much 
thomas tuchel on changing formation next season i think the structure suits our players well not only rudiger and christensen but thiago silva our midfielders and ben chilwell and reece james via 
i voted for him but i was expecting thiago silva to win 🤣 
tuchel on changing his formation next season i don't see it as a problem of structure it suits our players like ben chilwell thiago silva and reece james adding he doesn't need to change it but might be forced to depending on how his squad looks cfc chewat 
congratulations but thiago silva 
can't understand who voted mount over thiago silva 🙈 
i'd even prefer kovacic than mount all in all thiago silva deserves it more 
huge shout out to thiago silva as well he was magnificent throughout this season and as equally deserves to win this award as mount 💙 proud to have a defender like him at the back 👊 cfc thiagosilva 
congrats to mason mount but massive shoutout also to thiago silva who was equally deserving amp my pick defying age at 37 amp one of the best free signings we ever made 👏🏾💙🙏🏾 
yes before people go crazy thiago silva absolutely deserved pots 
thiago silva deserved it 
rudiger was world class this year thiago silva was better as well i hate the english bias 
has thiago silva been a joke to you 
sure in chelsea's history also signing thiago silva at over 35yrs turns out to be a great one 
thiago silva robbed 
unbelievable he is so overrated thiago silva robbed 
not deserving at all thiago silva should had won it costing us in big matches proves he is not all that yet 
thiago silva deserved winner🙂 english biass is real 
i voted silva as well felt thiago really deserved it but it's a public vote so is what it is congrats to mase 
thiago silva robbed 
the lion thiago silva played 48 games for chelsea this season more than he played in one season throughout his career he will turn 38 in september he deserves to be the player of the year but chelsea fans prefer the beautiful player 
so happy for mason 23 and a future chelsea legend i voted for thiago silva but i'm thrilled for mase 💙 
lool who apart from thiago silva 
thiago silva robbed 
really should be reece james or thiago silva 
thiago silva robbed 
thiago silva robbed 
this is a joke thiago silva deserve it more 🤦🏽‍♂️ 
congrats to mason mount👏👏💙💙 i knew it would be between him or thiago silva 
thiago and mount both were deserving the amount of times silva saved our asses 
so as thiago silva but even more influential 
same and i rep mount thiago silva was immense 
thiago silva robbed blind 
congratulations mason 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 thiago silva too deserves this honour 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 
thiago silva fell off you can actually talk about mount without disrespecting silva 
voted for thiago silva too but can't say mase doesn't deserve it either 
thiago silva was my choice but not rudi 
thiago silva easily mount covered up his stinkers and inconsistent performances with g a against bottom table clubs he was even better last season east to win when you're fan favourite and matchgoers votes counted more lol 
nah thiago silva and reece james deserved this ahead of mount if the club gives this award simply based on g a threat means a defender can never win and that's just wrong 
obviously thiago silva 
when i deep it thiago silva should've won it easily icl he should be in the world 11 
bullshit should have been thiago silva 
thiago silva deserved it as well if not more 
thiago silva deserves one more season until his replacement is brought up to speed with rudiger leaving he is easily still our best cb 
we need two ball playing center backs with at least one being really good with line breaking long balls think passing abilities of luis and defense of rudiger think a younger thiago silva 
thiago silva pount cost us two trophies 
i wanted thiago silva to win it 
oh how it's thiago silva for me but what do i know 
i don't remember watching a bad thiago silva game🚮 
take away thiago silva or rudiger and we are not in europe next season lad 
yeah it was between him or thiago silva 
thiago silva chelsea pots 
does thiago silva play tennis 
personally i'd go with thiago silva or rudiger 
stupid fan base voting 😂 thiago silva deserved it mount cost chelsea 2 cups final and been poor majority of the season 
gifting this man pots ahead of thiago silva 🤡🤡🤡🤡 
it should be thiago silva 
like if you think thiago silva deserve it more 
thiago silva has been better 
looool i only said smh na mason mount was our best player this season rudiger a close second thiago silva somehow felt off at least imo 
sorry folks thiago silva has been outstanding mount didn't turn up in the big games and cert wasn't consistent all season

thiago silva was my pick as well but i think mount had a good season in terms of numbers so may be that edged it

kovacic is up there and thiago silva 
you've just forgot about thiago silva 
hampir own goal kalo thiago silva ga saved🥲 
kepa is coming in for thiago silva 😂😂😂😂😂 
moments after sarr replaces kenedy azpi hits a pass back to the far post with mendy ready for a pass way out towards the near edge of the box thiago silva has to prevent the og wow 
thiago silva rudiger kovacic reece james all exist bro 
thiago silva was at fault for 3 4 benzema goals not ng 
and thiago silva free 
rudiger and thiago silva 
thiago silva has been clear 
only legend pauleta played handball or basketball or you are too young to remember him thiago silva ibra di maria they can easely be named club legends benz modric kroos ramos and others from newer generation are not just some very good players they are legends in madrid 
no fit centre backs have you seen how many games rudiger and thiago silva have played 
can run the xenophobic fanbase narrative if he wins over thiago silva and kova 😋 
this will be the exact same case for colwill with thiago silva needs to learn as much from him as possible i think this is a massive reason for him not to go on loan again 
probably said the same thing about thiago silva because you think good players are fifa players 🤣🤣 
thiago silva surely😍 
thiago silva for the main award🤞 
little thiago silva is on the lift of the photo 😅😅 
people don't realise 4 defenders are leaving us with thiago silva only staying till next season and they won't academy players to play against watford 
thiago amiera silva so proud of her onto next weeks cup final now 1 down 1 to go ⚽️❤️👏🏽 
thiago silva all the way 
before we go on that can you tell me her role in chelsea the chiwell you are hailing it mendy you bought them or the thiago silva 
ahaha thiago silva reece james and mount all comfortably sit in there 
thiago silva chelsea player of the year 
not many dm's in the world would win major trophies with two 8s in front of them unless one has very high ball retention amp excellent passing i e b silva thiago kante also needed jorginho to hold his hand at least in the last few years he was terrible as a dm himself 
even thiago silva who is a defender is no more a pressing monster ole was way better than this ralph godfather guy 
yea ik russell defending like prime thiago silva atm tho 
damien duff 👀 thiago silva 
so basically we're left with 37 year old thiago silva at cb only are we buying 5 cb 
good rewards 😂 i won 3 today and my best was thiago silva 
will thiago silva start 
and thiago silva 
thiago silva isn't even 6'0 and he's doing fine 
gotta back my boys mane toney and thiago silva 😂 
and then proceeds to post a picture of thiago silva 
what about thiago silva 
🤝 but how about thiago silva 
mount and thiago silva with the awards please 
thiago silva plays volleyball 
reece james in midfield is pure madness kounde at rb is shite no attacking presence hudson odoi and lukaku don't make me laugh 40 yr old thiago silva at cb in a back 4 and chilwell who will most likely be half the player he used to be in a back 4 kovacic dembele good 
wizkid is messi davido is ronaldo burna boy is zlatan ibrahimovic olamide is benzema man has been doing well on a low ckay fireboy or rema can be mbappe kizz daniel is neymar wande coal is thiago silva 
mount has tuchel rudiger thiago silva reece james kovacic jorginho and kante who would never concede hazard had alonso david luiz bakayoko drinkwater and lost costa in 2017 
thiago silva cost us the first goal but no one will say that 
they can afford him tuchel and thiago silva he's probably staying tho 
thiago silva plays volleyball 
alright defender but 60 year thiago silva challenges him which isn't a good thing g 
come play with tuchel and thiago silva you'll play in the best league another champions is waiting for you have a good day 💙✌🏾 
thiago silva is 37 lmao shut up 
thiago silva mason mount 
great team i wouldn't take a hit i guess you could do kdb to son but i would maybe consider thiago silva to sessegnon appreciate it seems strange not maxing out your funds on the final day but has a much higher ceiling imo 
just because it was not extended doesnt mean it is disrespectful it means that he is no longer part of their project happened the same to thiago silva in psg just because he wasnt renewed it doesnt mean that madrid does not value his contributions he is a legend in the club 
na only thiago silva be chelsea player 
fairs chiellini and peak thiago silva were better imo but i suppose ferdinand deserves his place in your time watching 
i think chelsea new owner will want to make a statement signing tuchel and neymar have a very good relationship chelsea is the only destination i see for him thiago silva connection also 
22 nkunku 23 mendy e 24 jota 25 rodri 26 aubameyang 27 rafael leao 28 thiago silva 29 reece james 30 rodrygo this is all according to the shit criteria the ballondor uses 
this is not the news i want to hear but i was also thinking thiago what do you think i'd luv a mount cross and silva goal 
then again thiago silva is only 6ft and is one of the best cbs in the league height really isn't a defining factor 
how is neymar to chelsea not a team building what's thiago silva 💙 football before chelsea as long as neymar plays football or you got potentials you could be anything good to a club i'm not one for all this who should play and who not its d board business wld i bleed 💙 
thiago silva is small and wc 
solid signing and will play for the badge on the shirt just because he's 35 doesn't mean he's finished look at bamba 37 thiago silva 37 to name a few 
it's just okay sanchez said no to man city thiago silva said no to barcelona haaland said no to man utd see 🤝 
international trophies won by thiago silva 3 both paldini and dogmos combined 3 🤣 
league titles won by thiago silva 8 league titles won by bottler paldini 7 league titles won by dog penmos 6 
i know it's only a concept but i just think if someone's making the strongest team thiago silva has to be in it 
we can dream and tbf i can see it he loves tuchel and tuchel loves him so its a perfect match also thiago silva and him are mates so yh 🙏💙 
tunde na you dey talk this one so imagine neymar going toe to toe with someone like van dijk or kyle walker even trent arnold or gray epl is aggressive even 37 year old thiago silva go show am shege 
lol thiago silva 
thiago silva is also the same heigh😏 
thiago silva is 511 and is one of the best in the business 
why do you think chillwell thiago silva and kai were bad signings 
not true look at thiago silva no one thought he would be that good in the prem especially at his age 
your oga de call you aris thiago silva come defend 
just remembered that neymar jr and willian told thiago silva to join chelsea hhhhmm 
just remembered that neymar and willian told thiago silva to join chelsea hhhhmm 
so you'd rather have harry maguire amp tyrone mings ahead of thiago silva raheem stirling ahead of vinicius jr aladdin neymar amp fabiano walk into an england team 
yes lmaooo no be leonardo assemble them diallo gana parades danilo draxler midfield no be am no renew thiago silva for 2 years but gave it to injured ramos i don dey support psg for a while now leonardo had to go wayy before messi came 
remember players have rejected these teams before even with their huge monies ferran tores left mancity for barcelona thiago silva left psg for chelsea what's your point 
kova kante mount havertz and thiago silva 
they'll have senior citizen thiago silva and mylungs sarr 😭😭 
thiago silva is 6ft timber is 5 10 those 2 inches make a massive diffenrce and silva is one of the best cb around timber isn't close to his level yet just because one small cb adjusted doesn't mean they all will 
expect two of my strikers richarlison and salah not starting slight doubt about thiago silva 
nah that man is joining thiago silva at chelsea 
highly doubt brazil can win it all with thiago silva in a back 4 
already empty when thiago silva left 
there is a lot of bias around age chelsea's thiago silva is 38 real madrid's modric is 36 ac milan ibrahmovic is 40 so let's not say 30 year old kostic is somehow not good to play for spurs he is the kind of signing that will take the club to next level 
chelsea got an old thiago silva free and he was good so maybe chiellini can replicate that 
the only trophy remaining in their cabinet is ucl he's collecting trophies with that psg what is wrong with french football even ronaldinho played there zlatan cavani even thiago silva was there go and check ligue 1 keenly it's a good league 
he is signing what we can not what we needed he tries to sign pogba while knowing his history of just jogging and not coming back on a defense in psg we are lacking people that could help veratti he sign wijnaldum extend kurzawa sign sergio ramos and kick thiago silva 
has thiago silva's contract been extended 
example 1 which destroys your argument lisandro martinez 5'9 with an aerial duel win percentage of 71 lol that's better than kounde thiago silva konate matip ruben dias and laporte makes u wonder 
5'9 with an aerial duel win percentage of 71 lol that's better than kounde thiago silva konate matip ruben dias and laporte makes u wonder 
agent thiago silva do what you gotta do boehly said he wants to make a statement signing i think this qualifies 
you want to see thiago silva eating marquinhos 
he's 4 cms shorter than thiago silva 
thiago silva is 511 and was one of the best cbs in the world at one point convo ended 
thiago silva has done pretty alright in fact was one of the best cbs in the world at some point so why can't timber be 
😂😂 and they leave out kante and thiago silva that lineup no be chelsea lineup na cardiff lineup b dat 
say mums telles starts for them 😭 also the only good player there is thiago silva and hes 70 
source 
gutted that today will be antonio rudiger's last game with chelsea watched his video on youtube tonight not many players sit down and talk so openly about their career at chelsea will never forget that tackle in the ucl final on phil foden thank you toni ruediger 💙 
i'll tell you what sarr is garbage has no football brain and is too rigid but your whole account is idolizing saul niguez it's selective blindness 😂 
all the best for the future saul niguez💙 
player saul niguez score 100 don't think it's fair to rate him with such a small and divided sample size why did we sign him only to not use him ridiculous from everyone involved in the deal do feel for him and wish him goodluck wherever the future takes him 
saul niguez el shit 
saul niguez 
breaking kenedy and saul niguez start for chelsea against watford via 
breaking kenedy and saul niguez start for chelsea against watford via cfc chelseafc chewat 
goalkeeper kepa arrizabalaga another player who may leave stamford bridge could start while the likes of malang sarr and saul niguez could be given some minutes youngsters such as harvey vale may feature but tuchel is unlikely to take any risks with werner's hamstring injury 
perfect picture i guess mason mount is the next chelsea fc captain 
my boy doing so good mason mount the starboy 
i don't know what these lots want mount to do city has debruyne bernardo gundogan mahrez sterling all creating chances for city but expect only mason to do the work for chelsea 
dude if your chelsea fan you support who won poty for the club mount was at least putting the work in and scoring and being a fucking workhorse silva probably would have voted for mason himself 
mason mount come to timbers 
yes but imo even with kante's stinkers he is a better 8 than mount the fact that mason didn't cost anything should not even be a consideration for squad place don't u wanna win epl titles again 
mason mount 7 5 10 player of the season with 29 g a amazing stats but does not pass the eye test all the time needs to improve on his decision making badly he can be a hell of player and future captain i really hope he can play as a 8 in a 433 next season keep 
mason mount better 🤡🤡🤡🤡😂😂😂💀💀💀💀 
of course she's cute but i can't imagine a situation of myself taking all bants just because harry maguire decided to take a bow for a mason mount's shot leading to a goal 
i prefer mason mount tears losing all 6 finals he has played at wembley 😭😭😭😭😭 
thoughts on mason mount overall mike 
mo salah is a poor man's mason mount 
english bastards protection do you seriously think every single manager that mason mount has played for has been forced to play him 🤣 
less ucls than mason mount 
mason mount tbf 
i call him 3times so good they named him 3times mason mount mount mount he was born in portsmouth but made in cobham coyb ktbffh ktf no to h8🇺🇦 champions of the world we know what we are💙⚽️🦁🏆 
well done mase mason mount fully deserved👏 
yea that's it mate even though mason mount made it on shortlist 
let's read the comments for all the hate on mount troll central absolute class act mason such a big player for chelsea 
so let's not get it twisted against the top 14 clubs mason mount scored 1 goal the stats say he dropped an 11 goal and 10 assist season look at the standard of sides that's what bruno get's mocked for at least he produces against mid table clubs 
the way y'all keep forcing mason mount content is just insane 
did you read what i even said lmao forget without him the club will do okay and with him they are doing okay chelsea lived without hazard mount not even up to lmao i personally even feel lukaku goals even had those points winning than mason in the league i might be wrong 
there's always an epl fanboy willing to share his fantasy like the guy i saw claim george best was a poor man's mason mount 
mason mount recce james rudigar 
worst moment losing ben chilwell to a season ending injury best player mason mount most disappointing player romelu lukaku most improved player kai harvetz 
you try perform with mason mount having to pass the ball to you maybe i should do a compilation of the number of times werner has tried to make runs and mount doesn't see him cause he runs with his head down 
goalkeeper of the season allison defender of the season rudiger thiago sliva midfielder of the season kdb thiago mason mount callagaher striker of the season son coach of the season klopp flop of the season player grealish useless club of the season man u ars 
i think our frustration with our attackers is clear and no one has been spared criticism the issue is this constant protection of mason mount like he's the best thing to happen to the club when he's far from it we'll struggle to find an attacker who can shine next to him 
what do you think of all the mason mount slander from chelsea fans 
mason mount deserved it stop the fake england bias thing…mount played every fucking game leading goal and assist and you still have a problem 
reece james kovacic his decision making passing overall forward play has been better mason mount 
hate to break it to you but mason mount is not frank lampard hope this helps 
the logic is insane infact had our attackers actually knew how to perform in the pedestal they've been put up on then mason mount wouldn't need to be starting 
mason mount is the white jesse lingard 
they rub mason mount wishing mount best of luck 🤞🤞 
nah man u didn't watch most of the games we played this season without mason mount we wouldn't have won most games i understand you're pissed everyone was pissed but there's nothing we can do i believe the whole team tried their best that's why we need to upgrade back tuchel up 
when they're both at their best mason mount has nothing over christian pulisic 
chelsea used to be a great club now we watch other teams battle for the league while mid players like mason mount win back to back pots standards have dropped drastically if we being honest 
depending on which version of them you're talking about last season mount is better than current pulisic and lockdown pulisic is better than any version of mason mount so far 
i can guarantee you chelsea fc will not win another league title as long as mason mount is a main player in the squad 
why is he the only one getting criticised pulisic costed us madrid liverpool yet its mount that has made us lose 2 trophies havertz has been shit for majority of the season ziyech hiding as usual do they get criticised as mason 
you need to learn ball and stop with the idiotic football takes everyone who knows anything about football knows mason mount is top drawer havertz has talent but is nowhere near mount's level yet if he could reach it chelsea would be a lot nearer liverpool maybe next season 
ben chilwell on coming on for 'best mate' mason mount but to come on for mase he said to me 'you've been brilliant working so well to get back where you are' to come on for him was nice what a brilliant season he's had as well via 
you're only pissed that we bottled two finals cos of the same mason mount 
mason mount on ben chilwell he brings the atmosphere up and that's the type of character he is brilliant to see him come on at the end there via 
mason mount on ben chilwell he's been so focused every single day on what he needed to do he did it with a smile on his face even though he wasn't with us the whole time it felt like he was with us via 
mason mount on antonio rudiger on the pitch that person and totally different off it a gentleman a pleasure to play with him over the last couple of years i've learned a lot from him we wish him all the best until we play against him via 
lateef mason mount 
difference being willian was a forward and was 30 plus mount is a 8 and is 23 lowering your standards it's actually realising that with a proper 9 like lukaku was supposed to be mounts numbers are fine but let's go at mason 
mason mount we need to keep going keep this level all the time we've shown it in competitions we need to do it in the premier league we want to win the premier league via 
mason mount we're very close i feel like we are on the brink of greatness but we need to keep the consistency going in the league we dropped off too much and we know that as a group via 
mason mount the two finals we lost this year we want that revenge we want to win it again it's been a tough couple of weeks for me personally but the way the fans are behind me and supporting me all the time it helps to keep going via 
mason mount we can see how tough this season has been and we still feel like we could have got more won more that's the level we set it's an honour to play with these lads this group of staff we'll be back this is not the end of us it's the beginning via 
mason mount if someone told me in my third season i'd win it twice i wouldn't believe them at all it's an absolute honour to play with these lads via 
i'm a mason mount fan btw 
maybe we're on different sides of ft cuz jorgi puli and even mendy get more criticism than mason mount especially from big accounts u can never bring up a tweet of goldberg calling out mount for his bullshit at times reece james is the real gem of cobham it's easy to see 
why y'all hating on mason mount 😂 
the only reason might be chelsea invaded ukraine amp general mason mount was fighting the war in ukraine chewat chelseafc 
he wasn't criticized armin just said his honest evaluation of mason mount which i wholeheartedly agree with 
what hype ☠️ if you actually think that mason mount isn't overprotected amp overhyped by the english media amp fans then stupidity is a term you are beyond help 
yh i do but i'm also one of his biggest critics u genuinely can't criticize mason mount on this app despite him playing a huge hand in costing us two trophies this season 
how to ensure the downfall of chelsea enter mason mount pr 
this will be a topic on the hangout mason mount deserves some damn respect 
a foundation of the rebuild mason mount 💙 
lol bro mount got a lot of unfair hate but his fans have become unreasonable and insecure just like j5 fans did made me dislike him and ruined mason for me too now still rate him as a midfielder but not a fan of him anymore tbh 
i wonder how some fools still say allot of things about mason mount despite what the young man has done so far despite the issues in the whole chelsea team so many wack players around him and he still play this hard and got this tally at the end of the season 
mason mount pics admn 
mason mount una 
how can mason mount be chelsea player of the season how i mean how this club is not even part of the top team's in europe

thought ok mason mount winning poty by statpadding against relegion fodder and fumbling huge chances in domestic finals 
especially mason mount he's the reason why we can't score a lot of goals 
player mason mount score 69 100 well… whether i praise or criticize i get cooked either way so just completely honesty this szn was a downgrade for him he did cost us various games including 2 finals but he did outscore assist our other forwards so this is a fair rating 
thats ok let's all laugh at chelsea losing 2 penalty shootouts to liverpool 😅🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂😅🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤣😅🤣😂😂😂😂 you thought your goalkeeper kepa would save the day then fucked it up and the mount of pressure mason mount had 😅🤣😂😂😂 
mason mount is winning ballon d'or next season 
more of mason mount pisc please 
he supports chelsea not mason mount micky mount ain't bigger than chelsea not everyone has a homosexual attraction like you mountsexuals have 
reece james is a million miles better than mason and actually unlike mount a life long chelsea fan yet mount is the more loved one who gets banners etc what's your explanation 
mason mount won player of the year 
no he didn't the club lost both games not mason mount 
once rightly mentioned the fact that stats mean shit if you've won fuck all during a season mason mount can win awards after awards and he did fuck all during the two domestic finals this only makes people's head spin if anything 
all that shit posting for fucking mason mount embarrassing 
let's compare stats mason mount job has one bitches several twitter user mrtringham job less bitches unheard of 
mason mount slander is not allowed here 
who brought mason mount in dfkm 
i ve always praised reece james since his debut for this club and i ve done the same for mount i love mason as much as reece but this season he has been injured a lot tbh silva deserved the trophy but i am glad for mount and i am sure james will earn it newt season 
the only reason might be chelsea invaded ukraine amp general mason mount was fighting the war in ukraine 
you know i know kai wasnt good with finishing lets say horrible for the sake of it but mount did the same to him in a cup final rather worry about that than a useless game but still should have scored both that mason created 
mason mount 
mason mount is a poor man's jacob ramsey 
kevin de bruyne sturridge lukaku christensen rlc musonda tomori cho solanke reece james nearly suffered the same fate sorta until tuchel came in the only one immune from this cycle has been mason mount 
congrats mason mount sam kerr and harvey vale cfc cfcw 
i believe that is legitimately the reason why mason mount won poty because it couldn't have been his general play because there were better players this season in our team 
he deserves this award and big congratulations to mason mount 
how are mason mount and eden hazard in the same sentence ffs 😭

the fact that you are against mason mount winning it says all i need to know about you you're not a serious supporter 
great mason mount 😂 
thiago didn't fall off he was equally deserving of the award but mason also a deserved winner p s i voted for mount 
go ask azpilicueta or mason mount what it means to miss a penalty a penalty is a full goal which you win as a result of attacking your opponent your logic would mean a 'tap in' should also count less compared to a shot from outside the box 
we have mason mount 😁😁🤩 
yeah it is obvious who voted for him the normal fans only abnormal fans without a braincell in their noggin don't appreciate mason mount 🖕 
we will never win the league with mason mount in the team 
mason mount is english 🤡 
congrats to mason mount👏👏💙💙 i knew it would be between him or thiago silva 
mason mount deserve it and he won it 
no na mason mount dem give 😏 
mason mount has been to so many finals at such an young age goal contributions in every stage of the ucl best is yet to come 
absolutely beautiful reading all the clowns moaning 🤡 😂😂😂 ole ole ole ole mason mount mount mount 🎶 madeincobham 🎉🥳💙 
he won player of d season again mason mount is really a fluke at least ur fluke 
from hazard being our pots to mason it's a massive drop in standard to be honest don't get me wrong i like mount but he can't be our key player if we were to compete with the likes of city and pool we need two key players that unlock defenders and take their chance to score 
congrats 💙mason a mount 2 climb next season do it 💙 cfc chelseafc chelsea 
massive congrats mason mount 
james reece and mason mount the last time played in the champions league 
mason mount 
i meant to say mason mount 😀😀 
would not have been my first or even second choice for this award but well done anyway mason for me silva or rüdiger was more deserving but mount was a clear 3rd for me given kova amp reece missed so many games through injury 👌 
looool i only said smh na mason mount was our best player this season rudiger a close second thiago silva somehow felt off at least imo 
i think it's time to leave mason mount alone…just allow him 😭😂 
the commentator said something while i was watching my game today chelsea vs watford that mason mount can't get the award because of chelsea current situation that all incoming awards were reverted

personally i couldn't care less if the likes of werner lukaku ziyech pulisic are sold and replaced by a player chosen by thomas tuchel this transfer window how bad must you be that mason mount has a higher goal contribution per 90 than you 😭😂 
honestly havertz werner lukaku ziyech pulisic and hudson odoi should be ashamed of themselves that they're nowhere near mason mount's goal contribution they're barely hitting reece james numbers who is a rwb missed half the season through injury 
3 0 watford 3 own goals from mason mount the made in cobham fraud

warra wembley final win for mason mount 
at least mason mount will enter midfield 
this tweet is the most honest analysis of mason mount imo 
that's how i see it is not a chelsea fan who is weird and just hacks at mason mount or she just insults him 
if mason mount wins a league title in the next 3 years can we agree he surpassed hazard legacy as a chelsea player 
correct score 4 0 mason mount first scorer 
while that's a ridiculous way to describe mason mount whose been by far our best player the last two years at the very least he actually plays for chelsea unlike the player you're fighting for your life to big up 
hope mason mount gives you his shirt 😁 
would cry if that happened mason mount to neymar has this sport seen a bigger upgrade 
similar situation to mason mount's absence earlier in the season i believe 
3 0 chelsea with mason mount scoring 
we cannot win the league next season anybody with that kind of expectation is just being delusional we're basically changing our entire team bar a few positions no lover of football thinks mason mount is chelsea's current problem either only his haters 
mason mount 
mason mount 
mason mount 
young player and player of the season should have been mason mount and mo salah 
i am majorly concerned about mason mount💙💙✅ 
we can't cover the truth that mason mount is very very poor in taking penalties he should learn something better for the team and he himself to stop be front when it comes to penalty shootout he always missed and you want us to cover him 're you even serious 
mason mount was given a chance and he took saliba hasn't even been given a look in that's the worst part if he'd played for us and he was bad then we could come to the conclusion that he's only good in france and move on to be given no chance whatsoever is just terrible 
mason mount is a very good player i don't understand your fanbase maybe we should give you guys mctominay so we can have mount what dyou reckon 
rip mason mount this makes me glad my main rival has him and i don't 
i'm hearing per sources mason mount is not good 
nobody plays as much games as well and if mason is your best player that tells you a lot about how terrible your team is imagine moving from hazard being our best player to mason mount what a fall 
grealish has proved himself at aston villa before that move and he is still better at football than mason mount i don't need current stats to see that mount had all the privilege he needed to play more games and adapt faster than pulisic odoi and the rest under frank 
neither is mount every player is different my point is that football has evolved beyond showboating data is what matters now what's your output to the team that's the most important and on that level nobody is currently better than mason mount at chelsea 
so why isn't klopp trying to sign him then cos that seems to be your yardstick this particular top manager doesn't want mason mount therefore mason mount is shit utterly ridiculous 
you must be mad i'll take mason mount at newcastle anyday 
mason mount 3 assists and 1goal 
3 0 mason mount hatrick 
is about the premier league not all comp do you know mason is chelsea top 3 best player and most important player in the premier league can't really say that for foden this season statistically mount beats him so what else does he need to win it 
thiago silva mason mount 
bayern munich should sign mason mount 
mason mount should keep the number 19 however reece number 2 ben chilwell number 3 and declan rice number 4 
i'm a chelsea fan through and through but mason mount is overrated doesn't help the team when we need it most 
respect mason mount stan uno 
cakap pasal player mana ni mason mount the great ke 
messi ronaldo lewandowski haaland mbappe benzema junior salah mane de bruyne foden modric that's before i tell you mason mount from my own team is a better footballer 
mason mount better than both by far no debate 
ridiculous the number of goals scored nor assisted can't be the benchmark of selecting best players in seasons esp if those players aren't strikers with that said phil foden is more influential as a player than mason mount 
start mason mount and we'll win 7 0 
mason mount haters always going to hate so proud of you cfc 💙💙🥰 
disregarding fix jarrod bowen with fix mason mount others foden maddison saka kulusevski 
hes coming chelsea sorry man you can have mason mount 
kevin de bruyne to score two or more mason mount to assist firpo and bed area to be carded 
only mason mount has hit double figures in the premier league romelu lukaku has eight league goals kai havertz has seven callum hudson odoi has one christian pulisic has six and hakim ziyech and timo werner have four apiece 
and mason mount isn't 
na mason mount be mmesoma 🤣🤣 
die hard fans of mason mount are the same people who wanted lampard as chelsea manager even if we don't win anything and constantly only play for top four football they think this young players are the way forward against city and liverpool 
not lies mason mount deserves the best 
chelsea really broke my heart after losing that two trophies to liverpool but what i can say is that i don't wanna hate mason mount so he should never try of shooting penalty again in crucial matches cfc 
totally a fix how can he mason mount should won this 
but you hardly say the same about mason mount who has played far more and missed more consistently 
mason mount 
isn't that how your mason mount sounded like last year 🤡 
seriously what's so special about premier league a league where mason mount and saka are scoring for fun 
because mason mount scores majority of his goals against bottom half teams bozo 
day light robbery bukayo saka had 12 epl goals and 6 assist no young player in the epl did that mason mount should be the second choice but here we are it just england thing biass and corruption 
reece james mason mount 
where is the relevance with mason mount then and use punctuation signs next time 
all because of mason mount and kai havertz 
who did foden score against and compare to mason mount 
mason mount over phil foden it is 
how did he beat mason mount daylight biasness 
this player comparison i posted at first was it laliga or seria a mason mount ball's in any pitch than foden that is fact and not brag 
😂😂😂 the funny thing about this tweet is that both players play for the same national team mason mount has more play time more physical appearance and more goals than him but unfortunately you guys think foden can chill with the big boy mason 
great question probably mason mount just about 
absolutely but we must keep mason mount too 
mason mount suppose to be the winner why is england fa have this hatred on chelsea football club 
yes he won the premier league young player but i don't think he's better than mason mount 
mnanikasirisha get mason mount in that saka foden debate numbers don't lie 
signing that amount of galacticos would undermine our academy and block young players coming through so you might be blocking the next mason mount or reece james 
mason mount is 10x the player hazard ever was he doesn't need 3000 touches of the ball to influence a football match that's why he looks like gervinho in real madrid when the system isn't built to make him look good 
ahead of mason mount pure joke 
phil foden is a better player than mason mount trent alexander is a good player foden deserves the award he has been immense this season 
why did you rob mason mount did he caused the war in ukraine 
we have to learn from rudiger's mistake and renew the contracts of important players such as mason mount reece james kovacets jorginho and kante 
mason mount got 7motm awards while foden got 1 daylight robbery 😏 
that same alexander arnold and saka also beat mason mount hope u understand now 
just don't let this out of context you donkey ain't no one fukkin comparing your ucl to ours it's about mason mount and his terrible luck in final chelsea are still the reigning champions as we speak now so go cry about it 
mason mount has more assists😂😂 
kdb played 29 matches this season salah was only away for a month because afcon was played within that period walsh still had 35 goals contribution this season kdb has 22 the young player of the season should have between arnold and mason mount another robbery 😏 
mason mount was robbed of the young player award you guys need to do better 
they lost to chelsea last season at home with a goal from mason mount 
mason mount good luck 👍🏻🔴⚪️ 
oga mason mount no be young boy again rest foden deserved it 
some players may have deserved this kind of privilege eden hazard genuinely deserved it but sadly he received neither the shameless backing nor the footballing support one thing is for sure though mason mount does not deserve this kind of privilege dogshit player 🍺 
guy u de watch match b4 u come here come de gv 'advice ' did u just mention mason mount like wtf ideally salah should be the pl player of the year but people are saying forget about the numbers and look at the performance in the pitch de bruyne has an edge over salah there 
you spelt mason mount wrong 
mason mount will arguably retire a chelsea player anyone who doesn't support the academy boys can lick a window 
mason mount deserve it more 
mohamed salah robbed ke mason mount robbed kevin de bruyne is d worthy winner and dere is no argument abt dat foden is also worthy even conor gallagher did better than that ur mount did dont mind d confused boy o jare good morning to you too 
football is more than stats salah hasn't been as affective since afcom if it was based on goals and assists then mason mount had only 1 less goal involvement than kdb so should he be in the running mount hasn't been the best player in a chelsea shirt 
mason mount 
english media is their biggest problem did you see the fraud dey committed yesterday by giving foden epl young player of year ahead of taa and mason mount common nauuu 
mason mount 
even mason mount foden just got lucky 
you guys didn't even mention mason mount smh 🤦🏾‍♂️ 
what is good about the morning you cheat after stealing premier league young player of the year from mason mount 🙄🙄 
morning you are fraud how do you give foden that thing instead of mason mount 
there is no question in my mind i take no pleasure in saying this but mason mount is a brilliant footballer best of that young english talent group he doesn't quite pull off a lot of the audacious genius things he tries but the level of his thinking yikes fantastic 
mason mount deserve to win the poty over kdb 
mason mount ypoty 
de bruyne has been ghosting the whole of first half of the season rodri nd berbardo have been there from game 1 they deserve it more as for foden i don't know anymore the kid was not remotely even close to saka and mason mount 
even mason mount was robbed at daytime 
who is mason mount again 
he's not coming for mason mount place lmao your boy should be scared 
these are dreams no come true lewandoski neymar haha i can't see mason mount gallagher wasted on the bench 
mason mount deserves it but he is chelsea player cos chelsea join hand with russia dey fight ukraine 
mason mount is one of the best players we have in chelsea this season not even only in chelsea but in epl 
man rest apart from goals and assists mason mount is far better than phil foden this season 
mason mount robbed 
bet if his name was mason obi mount it'd be a different story 
bruh you're a havertz d ck rider not a chelsea fan don't sneak into our precious fandom while slandering our legends and mason mount go support psg that's a perfect club for you oil with no passion or determination 
the premier league is all about robbery… mason mount did better than foden this season there's arnold declan rice even saka but the foden hype gets him everything without even working hard 
what if he is ffs how are chelsea fans always on the heels of a chelsea player why does mason mount have to deal with rival fans and also deal with his own delusional fans why do chelsea supporters have to go at each other over our own player are you peepo ok lydis 
where is mason mount 
weldone mason mount 
phil foden 9 goals 5 assists amp 1 motm mason mount 11 goals 10 assists amp 7 motm officaly fraud awards 
bad take dembele neymar auba and our very own mason mount all had their best seasons under tuchel guys like pulisic just aren't good enough his only good patch lasted for a few months after lockdown 
mount is only mount i know not some shithole mason 
mason mount better 
madrid wanted both haalnd and mbappe and foden and saka as back up also recently james and mason mount 
mason mount 
hmm epl is now something else how is it possible i don't even understand how foden won the young player of the season ahead of mason mount and bukayo saka 😏😏 
mason mount and bowen were better than foden this season and didn't win it so honestly what even is this point your trying to make go call this shit out on racist white people tweeting hateful shit because they deserve it not because someone who was better won it over the other 
they all frauds robbed mason mount 
even less minutes played mason mount had a better season and statistic than kdb 
mason mount had a better season than foden and wasn't picked as well is that racist too heck even jared bowen has a shout and he's white but you will ignore that to keep the oppression going 
no way he was better than mason mount 
after today there will be no mason mount for 55 days 
goals and assists dont mean everything big fella your saying you think mason mount is a better footballer than phil foden delusional 
buy proven quality rather than potential watkins abraham kane sterling but buy them now not last day of the window let declan see you are genuine and he will sign a new contract also with chelsea sale stalling go for mason mount go for top 3 
we have to learn from rudiger's mistake and renew the contracts of important players such as mason mount reece james kovacets jorginho and kante 
mason mount 
and mason mount lets be clear here 
yes i watch the games and is a super good football player i like him as a player and as a mason i will always stand by mason mount and support him 
couldn't get derby promoted with mason mount fikayo tomori and harry wilson in what was one of the weakest championship renewals in years he's a myth 
mason mount 
kai havertz 7 10 solid season with up and downs but still our best attacker i definitely want him to stay and hopefully he can flourish next season not sure if he's the ideal n9 but i'm sure he'll be an important player for us next season aswell keep 
kai havertz … mbappe … 
james was really good i thought kai havertz would be a strong contender 
our own king kai havertz🔥🔥 
it's well you have that tittle but to me it should have been kai havertz 
that kai havertz guy and finishing we are set for disappointment if he does not enroll for finishing lessons 
everything you just said relates back to kai havertz 
reece james kai havertz thiago silva robbed 
not a chelsea fan but i think kai havertz or silva 
player kai havertz score 65 100 dissapointing especially after the end of last season he did have a couple really good games still one of our top scorers but he just doesnt have any consistency and im not entirely convinced yet that he has what it takes to be a 9 
ok but kai havertz dribbled past ederson and city never won a champions league 
man city need to appreciate kai havertz for playing a big role in them winning the premier league 👏🏽 
you talk like he's ahead of havertz with more than 1 goal kai has 20 g a this season and like i said before he's won us big games and more point than any other attacker in that team you've got nothing on him 
this talk is about chelsea and name on bad final havertz has had remember not saying kai deserved poty not by any thread but he is much more a big game gene 
if you watch each of them you will know that they are special kai havertz from bayern leverkusen and he succeeded 
no player has missed more big chances for chelsea this season 12 than kai havertz 💪🏼💪🏼 
no player has missed more big chances for chelsea this season 12 than kai havertz 💪🏼💪🏼 
is kai havertz a joke to you 
do whatever you like with this stat… kai havertz scored the same number of non penalty goals in the league this season as bruno fernandes did last season 
king kai havertz 🐂 
wen kai havertz scored that goal gt gt gt her warm bossom 
i think so to both questions consistency is need to get the best out of players and realistically only 1 2 get that i also think certain players performances have been hindered by injuries of other players the likes of lukaku havertz amp mase kai amp mase having to play wider 
genuinely insane and it's the majority of the online support the same people who think kai havertz is the new neymar there's a lot of very very stupid people out there 
the competition back than was immense which striker was competing with him this season kai havertz 8 goals or rom with similar contribution may cho might have a shout this season our defense were shambles as well stop crying amp enjoy 
ngolo kante kai havertz shouldn't be there yes kante is a legend but it's time to let him go 
congratulations and my dear chelsea fans for this last home win and silky german kai havertz for ur ending season goal 😘 
kai havertz stans on suicide watch 
when kai havertz got the same haircut with mason mount and now i couldn't tell their different from a far 
how much is kai havertz sef 😂😂 
would you say lewandowski moves like havertz does they are different players ffs kai's main position is a 10 btw what do you expect 
ht chelsea 1 0 watford gol kai havertz bawa the blues unggul 
the famous kai havertz 💙💙🥶 
😆 if he's starting for england in the world cup i might put money on the usmnt the guy is awful so is kai havertz and timo werner but since their german it's fine 
mason mount and kai havertz celebrate havertz' goal against watford 📸

saul and kenedy are starting today kai havertz mason mount and cesar azpilicueta also come in cfc chewat 
kai havertz is scoring today 
well i'd leave kai havertz we might not need lewa 
breaking mount azpilicueta and kai havertz start 
why does she looks like kai havertz 
kai havertz mason mount 
kai havertz followed sunderland 👀 
no everyone contributed in their respective wins you're the one trying to assign individual accolades kai havertz wasn't the only one on the pitch and it was thanks to tt's tactics team selection and support from his staff as well as the players why we won 
yes kai havertz 
none of them has scored in a ucl final the only goal that won the title assisted in supercup final scored the winner in fifa club world cup kai havertz is the meaning of generational 
facebook deactive kora you left a comment there too search 'if kai havertz was a bollywood actor' it should come up first thing 😂 
havertz kai havertz 
tbh true insecurity ekhon onek beshi oi group e the peak flcb was regarding memes was that 'if kai havertz was a bollywood actor' thread i still laugh going through the comments 3 
kai havertz just followed crystal palace on instagram 👀😱 
kai havertz just unfollowed chelsea on instagram 👀😱 
you're a kai havertz fan not a chelsea fan 
thought that was kai havertz signed for the teddy's 
kai havertz i stop reading after you mention his name haha 
only mason mount has hit double figures in the premier league romelu lukaku has eight league goals kai havertz has seven callum hudson odoi has one christian pulisic has six and hakim ziyech and timo werner have four apiece 
what do you think about kai havertz he's tall athelic quick good with heading and can play as a striker ss winger am something what benzema does i mean surely he'll not come cheap but what you say about him being a 'galactico' he's younger than 💵🐍🐢 
diaz mount foden havertz because kai is the only one we are not sure about starting 
all because of mason mount and kai havertz 
kai havertz at any cost 😂 
kai havertz seeing this tweet 
we don't care if lewa joins baarka we have big benz try to sign kai havertz at any cost 
i think havertz is a great differential lukaku will get a rest timo had hamstring problems unless we see jude soonsup bell i think it's kai up top 
in delirious laughter remembering i started this season thinking chelsea might win the league and happy we had a real striker again for it to end with us second to last on motd and needing a last minute ross barkley goal to beat an already relegated watford 
got ross barkley on my last season villa kit i think it's a w 
you let ross barkley score against you have some shame 😂 
😂😂😂 you dey city hold your body ross barkley score today paa no bro dey care 😂😂😂😂 
i think ross barkley jorginho alonso and the others are leaving chelsea also 
also ross barkley the blokes timeless 
is it fitting that ross barkley in many ways the epitome of a 21st century chelsea signing should be the man to score chelsea's final ever goal 
i think he's getting use to the style of play just need more time to prove himself we should talk about ross barkley 
that's such a ross barkley thing ffs 
ross barkley my foot that b doesn't even come close to the contribution made by this man to liverpool's success during his time there how dare you make such a comparison 
i'd put a bid in for ross barkley too 
i love ross barkley 😂😂 
ross barkley has scored 
viva ross barkley come on chelsea see you next season epl 
ross barkley 
your tweet was quoted in an article by insidesport 
ross barkley as well 
viva ross barkley 
i pray we keep ross barkley 😭💙🙏 
this is not about what he is smoking barkley is a fantastic player with good eyes for goal and has a good vision to create goals if given the chance he would av done better the only place i see weakness in ross is his marking ability which can also be improved 
ross barkley is six years older than our two time back to back player of the season who has provided a winning assist in the ucl final 
can defo understand people thinking silva should've got it but some people are acting like we've given it to ross barkley or something 
this is embarrassing a guard of honor for a player whos been a rotational squad member at best for 7 years does that mean we should give batshuayi or ross barkley guard of honors when they leave this summer 
thomas tuchel on ross barkley he was excellent in the no 10 very dangerous involved in every dangerous attack when he came on so i'm happy when he scored via 
think he owes ross barkley a beverage 
thomas tuchel on late winner for ross barkley in his 100th game was a very nice moment i'm happy for ross but i'm also happy for all of us because it would've been a bit too much at the very end of the season so very happy via 
ross barkley 
where's ross barkley 
ross barkley robbed 
exactly and he was piss poor so can you imagine the other forwards mount getting better every year i need ziyech werner rlc lukaku ross barkley and pulisic gone 
ross barkley🐐🤝 
ross barkley🐐🤝 
ross barkley🐐🤝

ross barkley last minute winner in the biggest game of the day wow 
personally rather see barkley play over jorginho i know that's controversial amongst chelsea supporters but ross actually gets in the box and has more movement 
same thing i kept asking myself like isn't he seeing what i saw in ross barkley with ross barkley kante and kovacic the midfield is captured 
was definitely not celebrating a ross barkley winner lad wrong game 
it was your mistake to not play ross barkley and kenedy 
not impressed by this too many drawn games and thank goodness for ross barkley we could have had another one today chelsea should not be losing games at the bridge period 
my man plays like prime kaka with oil city but plays like fuckin ross barkley with germany

putting rlc upfront in a final then subbing him off 5 minutes later for ross barkley is a decision we don't need to know the ins and outs of he's making weird decisions 
ross barkley it is written 
actually she was in charge of extending a few players' contracts to earn a profit when the wisest thing would've been to let them go also who buys lukaku for 98m you think thats a bargain danny drinkwater ross barkley the list goes on 
pal chelsea lukaku drinkwater ross barkley 20m 
ross barkley not being here truly upsets me 
as i said kovacic has more cls than chelsea but who tf cares about that oh yeah of course except for madrid fans as most of them traded their logical sense for spamming 13 ucls in every convo 💀 and now you bring ceballos into this then i guess ross barkley gt gt gt kroos 😂😂

dan gosling is better then toni kroos 
⚽️ biggest cheer of chewat came with the news of mancity scoring the third title clinching goal… and it coincided with watford equalising at stamford bridge 😬 courtesy of masina's cross dan gosling's header and chelsea' static defending 
dan gosling still scoring against us confirm 6 no doubts 
it took me 37 games and 87 minutes to find out dan gosling played for watford whats the longest it's taken any of you to realise a player is at a particular club 
even dan gosling is better then your onlyfans 
dan gosling 4 year deal in my honest opinion 
dan gosling's header for watford gives the next three fans a plinusa mug 👇 myplmorning 
was in the midst of typing my dan gosling tweet and this happens 
dan gosling in 2022 i'm fucking dead 
dan gosling equalised for watford this is the most mad afternoon of barclays i've ever witnessed 
dan gosling as above 
stopped me dead in my tracks the world champions conceded to dan gosling 
city scoring by any chance lol certainly not because dan gosling equalised against chelsea 
how's dan gosling scored then😂😂

in all of them for me eddie nketiah and wilfried zaha were the best players in that last pl matchday 
other budweiser football king of the match winners 👑 antonio rudiger 👑 callum wilson 👑 eddie nketiah 👑 james maddison 👑 pascal gross 👑 wilfried zaha 
it's because it's wilfried zaha if he did that to gallagher or mitchell or someone he wouldn't even have posted it

wilfried zaha 14 has more goals than any arsenal player 11 and 13 more than 72m pepe 
i get that but the money palace wanted for wilfried zaha upfront in 1 lump sum was ridiculous given his stats i like zaha as a player btw buying pepe who was 3 years younger had great potential amp the fee could be spread in installments over a longer period made sense imo

when did trent alexander arnold start playing for barca 
foden won when trent alexander arnold saka mount and rice all deserved it more insane pr lmao 
it's not even a question the answers trent alexander arnold 
trent alexander arnold 9 10 again incredible 14 goal contributions the highest in the prem for a defender great defensively as well most notably his goal line clearance against newcastle only way is up for our starboy 
let him go and win the ucl fifa's club world cud and europa super cup like trent alexander arnold ❤️❤️ 
trent alexander arnold 14 g a reece james 14 g a reece james missed 3 months of football lol 
i'm a chelsea fan but i go for trent john alexander arnold 
trent can't defend alexander arnold 
reece james has the same amount of g a as trent alexander arnold while having played 6 games less if i speak i am in big trouble 🤷‍♂️ 
huge save from john ruddy on trent alexander arnold's shot now there's a sentence i didn't expect to write today livwol liverpoolfc wolves 
trent alexander arnold needs to learn how to play as a defensive wingback it's good shit that he's got a killer cross but when you can't defend as a defender it's bad 
7 may 2019 later that season div is pressed into service to overturn a 3 0 1st leg deficit in a champions league semifinal against barcelona due to firmino and salah being injured his brace including the quickly taken corner by trent alexander arnold send lfc to the final

second j is following with trent alexander arnold path first with leg and now with hair e remain make him do corner taken quickly and start bringing pounds come for him papa and mama 
trent alexander arnold they have an outstanding team and outstanding manager but i would like to have seen them in 20 years time when i hang my boots up rather than now 
trent alexander arnold on man city yeah i admire them they're probably the best team in the world you can take your pick between us and them you have to admire a team that wins games continuously and i admire them 
i've liked if liverpool win please could i get a trent alexander arnold shirt 
oh and reece has a whopping 5 clean sheets in the pl compared to trent can't defend alexander arnold's measly 17 
son to score 2 goals trent alexander arnold 1 assist brownhill booked gallager booked 
sounds good will add trent alexander arnold gets two assist and passing salah as well 
cheated his way to the pl player of the season awards as well when salah mane son kane and even cr7 have been much better this season don't forget trent alexander arnold has had some insane attacking stats for a defender 
salah also has more assists than any other player in the premier league with his total of 13 one more than teammate trent alexander arnold as per 
xhaka and firpo carded son to score two and trent alexander arnold to assist 
firpo brownhill son trent alexander arnold

trent alexander arnold controls a game too from rwb but doesn't get young player of the season either🤔 
i want trent alexander arnold on mine 
second on the list is alison becker what an impressive goal keeper he's been the real colossus sadio mane have been impressive since the turn of the year deserves player of the season too trent alexander arnold always making critics to eat their words 
trent alexander arnold have 15 assists this season in the league bukayo saka have more goals and more assist all the start beat pure folding start this season so hope you understand me now 
he wasn't nominated for senior player of the season – unlike trent alexander arnold and bukayo saka so both alexander arnold and saka were considered better players than foden but worse young players whatever that means 
also you'll be shocked that the past 5 players who have won this awards have been deli ali 2 sterling leroy sane and trent alexander arnold suddenly a white player wins it it's racist 
bro he's 2 months younger than trent alexander arnold who's just been nominated for tpoty but we're meant to think mbappe has thrown away the prime of his career

thiago alcantara · see more anfield watch · 3h 🚨 new thiago has a right hamstring injury and is a major doubt to be fit for real madrid next saturday awlive sky

low key you look like thiago alcantara 
hopefully thiago alcantara is ok for paris m8🤜🤛✊🍻 
but on a serious i don't see us beating real madrid without thiago alcantara i just don't see it we need a miracle 
but one player that stood at the top for me this season is thiago alcântara he was absolutely amazing throughout 
he developed talent in barcelona messi wasn't the person he was when pep took over he also brought in sergio busquets pedro pique wasn't who he was when he was w manu thiago alcantara kimmich also iniesta and xavi revolutionized their game thanks to peps tactics

thiago alcantara must come back to barcelona 
man you ever watch thiago alcantara play pure art 💯💯🙌 
here's the link 
the coach is talking about needing to bring in a new center midfielder to help fill the gap left by injuries to players like mohamed salah and sadio mane they are also saying that the team needs to have a rotation system in place in order to keep p 
are u saying no decision went in favour of liverpool at all i thought milner should have gone off against city likewise sadio mane against chelsea it is what it is the league table tells no lie city deserved to be champions good luck in paris wish u all the best 
perhaps the biggest revelation in 2022 was sadio mane's revival in the central role he had been average for some time on the lw but was outstanding in the new position his contribution to the team in the second half of the season was much better than salah's in my opinion 
join sadio mane fc or resign a contract 
i thought sadio mane vs norwich was bang average 
no room for l g b•t no champions for lg bt allohuakbar i'am mosleem same as sadio mane naby keita dan ibrahim konate 
player legend king of the kop amp sensational senegalese international sadio mané became the 1st player in over a century to score on the final day of 4 successive prem league campaigns the last player to do so was ronald orr whose streak went from 1908 to 1911 
apart from premier league trophies what achievement does kdb have than sadio mane 
alisson or sadio mane for me 
we missed out on mario gotze guess who we ended up with brilliant sadio mane 
overall sadio mane win the champions league and he should get the ballon dor 
sadio mane never been off 
in 2020 epl golden boot was shared among mo salah sadio mane and aubumeyang what now change 
wow mate really couldn't tell i really thought sadio mane losing a spelling bee in 2006 would upset the brighton fan 
nice spelling bee win for sadio mane in 2006 
sadio mane new contract 📝 
if liverpool wins the champions league sadio mane should win it but ke he might just have too much melanin 
mo needs a rest he'll be back better than ever next season but he's not been up to his usual standard since afcon sadio mane is lfc player of the year awesome 
after careful consideration and as much as i would like to my game to be like sadio mane i think it's my duty to take up a midfield role like this fella 🤣 
when was the last time you heard sadio mane say anything good about city pure class kev 
yeah you're right brother but you got two players this season and it all depends on the ucl final sadio manè and benzema 😁😁 
congrutulations africa who wins it's my congrutulations too for sadio mane 🇸🇳🇸🇳🥰 
dame a sadio mane 
sadio mane will win it for liverpoolfc 
4 a 2 pro real madrid 2 benzema 1 vini jr 1 modric gols do liver 1 salah 1 sadio mane 
sadio mane right 
it's between mo salah or sadio mane period it's time for africa 
for me it's sadio mane 
honestly i feel sadio mane had a better season didn't score as much but he broke the deadlock multiple times he kept liverpool sailing when they weren't in perfect form even infield play he was terrific football is not just about what happens in front of goal 
might slip through the cracks cuz of dissapointment of not winning the league but i see yu sadio mane box to box world best in a single game he played 9 10 11 not impressed with diaz and mo mo will find his feet but diaz needs to either perfect his game or pass the ball 
sadio mane deserves to win the balon d'or but i know they won't award him because he's from africa

what you should know is that there are match winners and there are trophy winners as well i would pick sadio mane over neymar anytime anyway not because of anything but because of their playing style and what they bring to the team 
here's how i'm lining up for gw38 transfers salah gt mane pukki gt toney 4 let's go sadio let's go reds would be wrong to go this far with liverpool bias and go for son now 😂 and a hit for toney due to alonso rumours good luck all fpl fplcommunity 
don't insist on where he was because sadio mane was born and raised in rural area however he's one of world's highest paid ❤️⚽🙏 lemme wait for my turn😄😄😄 
are for real what had sadio mane done this season to deserve epl best player huh 16 goals and 2 assist i can agree on mo salah but mane is a big no 
sadio mane has scored six goals on previous premier league final days as per 
apart from being a top scorer what more has he done for ghana sadio mane has won the afcon for senegal what has asamoah gyan done for ghana 
i was so dissapointed too that sadio mane was not nominated he had a way greater season than salah but ai keh 
sadio mane touted by basically all of football media for the ballon d'or was snubbed from nomination in favor of jwp saka and trent the latter two in turn losing ypots to foden who's not nominated for pots itself it's not an l not even an opinion it's a fact 
firpo amp brownhill cards sadio mane 2 goals and kdb assist 
sadio mane amp kevin de bruyne each to have over 1 shot on target was 3 1 6 1 as long as they both play i thought this decent value on w hill good luck today pleased with yesterday as i switched the juve game to 1 5 goals 
i don't even understand when goals and assist only became the credentials to be the best player… even in the liverpool team salah isn't the best player but sadio mane even the new signing guy ranks higher on game influence than him this season 
rdt as backup for karim lucas ocampos from sevilla bench vini rodrygo amp eden 👍 tchuameni mid ckm and cama fede ceballos is perfect theo hernandez as lb achraf as rb cb amp gk are great 🤔 sadio mane 
😁 i want sadio mane to win everything this season 
this is madness the only reason premier league did this to is because they want to reduce his point to compete for the ballon d'or against benzema though it's good for sadio mane because he deserves the ballon d'or 
madrid who've also given contracts to players that were in their time a bit extreme question a man united too who give players unnecessarily big contracts then players can't move onto other clubs due to wage demands i mean sadio mane is around same wages as dean henderson lol 
sadio mane for ballon dor its fuefa nolonger fifa 
let's forget mbappe let's focus on winger like sadio mane for madrid he would perform at his peak in real madrid trust me 
let's forget mbappe let's focus on winger like sadio mane for madrid he would perform at his peak in madrid trust me 
let's forget mbappe let's focus on winger like sadio mane for madrid he would perform at his peak trust me 
same they tried during the penalty against sadio mane playing the last penalty against chelsea mendy so subtle 
let's forget mbappe the deeds has been done let's focus on a better winger like sadio mane that guy would perform excellently in madrid 
none of the above for me i wish for sadio mane 
whether we win the league or not this season has been incredible 2 trophies out of 3 domestic trophies is a huge achievement and probably with the big ears coming in next week hope and pray that mohammed salah and sadio mané will renew their commitment to the club come next seas 
not great for pl advert for a defensive midfielder like rodri or gk i don't believe in this assertion diaz won it last year so possibly one too many however my personal vote goes to sadio mane ask to perform in any area of the pitch and the legend delivers 
my favorite forward nowadays luis dias sadio mane and mohammed salah then the super subs fermino and jota for dias and mane midfielders for tough games i like thiago fabino and captain henderson 
none of your players even gave a fuck about consoling mendy after tsimikas scored they just walked off 😭😭 left for sadio mane to console him because your team didnt have the bollocks to 
who voted and how were the votes done there is no way in this world or next kdb had a better season that mo salah or sadio mane i'm sure even in his pj when he was announced he must have been surprised kdb bawo 
second on the list is alison becker what an impressive goal keeper he's been the real colossus sadio mane have been impressive since the turn of the year deserves player of the season too trent alexander arnold always making critics to eat their words 
a you're including this season where he actually has been poor b unless you've got issues it's not hard to work out that i was talking about all comps… last year his league numbers were better than ballon d'or contender' sadio mane 
salah wasn't liverpool 's best either this tap in and penalty merchant isn't better than sadio mane by a stretch mane is a complete forward he may not be tapping in goals or scoring penalties but he makes things happen upfront the award belonged to sadio mane 
he is an african i'm not surprised sadio mane has won the africa cup of nations and might win the champs league but won't see the ballon dor we are not surprised 
sadio mane shirt 👏😂👍 
talk about white european trash he didn't even play a single final he has less goals less assist africans will not win even sadio mane has better ratings than kevib de bruyne 
i'll take sadio mane 
liverpool only because of sadio mane 😁 
hey pooja we're quite aware about how politics is involved in every institution in the world but in this instance kevin de bruyne and sadio mane have been most outstanding in the premier league this season and in my opinion kevin de bruyne is deserving because he did magic 
real should have focused on sadio mané or salah 
sadio mane after the final 
i'm in south africa will dm the address sadio mane for me 
so sadio mane deserved it then 
that's why i see know purpose in the knee of black lives matter because it has changed absolutely nothing even benzema will be awarded ballondor despite sadio mane winning quardupple or trebble 
just imagine sadio mane yh 
used to be one of my favourite players not any more look at sadio mane in comparison donating much of his salary to good causes around the world saying he doesn't need ferraris in the garage happy on 200k a week 
potentially speaking there are mo salah and sadio mane which still haven't extended their contracts darwin nunez is available and lewandowski if the money is right 
sadio mane in liverpool font 
whatever salah is offered if they don't offer it to mane will be a complete insult sadio is a whole season player not 2 3 of one 
phil foden has also won the same amount of champion's league trophies as manchester shitty 😃 
phil foden has completed football at 21 years old 
phil foden has now won more premier league titles 4 than 🏆🏆🏆 frank lampard 🏆🏆🏆 cristiano ronaldo 🏆🏆🏆 patrick vieira 🏆🏆🏆 yaya touré he turns 22 years old next week 😁 
another big away win was the 1 0 at everton in february when phil foden's 82nd minute goal was followed by a controversial decision to not give a penalty to everton for what appeared a clear handball by rodri

why is budget phil foden there 
phil foden against the top 6 
i thought phil foden was in manchester today 🤔 
phil foden and declan rice get a mention but no room for the joint golden boot winner 
phil foden's mum got battered and he stood there and watched 
with a assists from kevin de bruyne and phil foden and finishing from haaland 
you're like phil foden when he won his first premier league title 💙 now worked your ass off to continue winning more 👏🏼👍🏻 
he looks more like phil foden than phil foden does 
haha how many premier league titles do you have phil foden has 4 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🤪 
another phil foden haircut incoming 😉 
phil foden is a father at 21 and my parents didn't even meet until they were in their 30's 
phil foden 7 meh season by his standards but 25 g a and we're still walking away with smth 
your a little wet wipe 😂 you definitely jerk off to phil foden compilations 
statistics are just numbers absent the ability to meaningfully interpret them they can be misleading phil foden had 9 league goals and only 5 assists this year yet no rational argument can be made for him not being young player of the year 
he had 6 g a over 826 minutes of pl football this season which is 1 g a per 165 minutes that's a better ratio than ypoty 2021 22 phil foden 
21 year phil foden has more children than liverpool pl titles 😂

only manchester city and manchester united have more premier league trophies than phil foden phil foden is just 21 years old 😳 premierleague 
i think he meant phil foden 
why tf would phil foden be the young player of the season 
phil foden is also a massive chav 
11 goals and 10 assists in the pl those are great stats considering what the entire team managed to produce in terms of goals much better than phil foden who won ypoty with 9 goals and 5 assists in a high scoring team and mount is one of the hard workers off the ball too 
phil foden can piss on his and he'll still have another 3 in the cabinet 
phil foden just lifting his 4th premier league title at the age of 21 remind me again how mount is better mate 
5 bukayo saka instead of phil foden should have been awarded the premier league's young player of the season 
i wanna knoooooooow phil foden balls 
to be fair phil foden will end up with more than u 
your describe in one word about phil foden was two words it was very funny though 
saka is a midfielder with better goals and assist than any other player aged 21 or less while foden is a forward with less goals even in the same england step up saka is ahead in what respect is phil foden ahead of him 
phil foden not in this picture aswell i mind him sending me it to prove he had arrived in japan that was his real breakthrough season 
my dude only makes 150k a week have some respect 
phil foden was just impressive on the ball bt didn't match up to mount contribution throughout the season anyways still chelseas player of the season👊💙 mm 
phil foden jack grealish eplfinaleondstv 
phil foden winning the premier league 
phil foden reading this 
he's talking about phil foden and city bottling the epl title after having a 13 point lead 
ohh shut the hell up the only academy players city have had is phil foden atleast chelsea had mount reece chalaboah cho roftus cheek i mean he played both lewis hall and vale in caraboa cup 
if we lose kevin de bruyne and phil foden should be stripped their premier legue play of the season awards it will be a sham 
every time phil foden touches the ball it's like a little piece of art 
it's all finished at anfield liverpool have done all they can that salah goal was enough to seal the three points manchester city are still alive here phil foden de bruyneeeeeeeeeeeee i swear you'll never see anything like this ever again so watch it drink it in 
phil foden 95th min 
you arsenal lots are funny who's saka to foden 😂😂😂 phil is miles ahead 
phil foden to score or assist callum chambers to be carded 
phil foden scores pen mason mount misses pen 
who would you prefer at spurs mason mount of phil foden 
explain how taa the only young player nominee to also be nominated for poty youngest player ever to win all six major trophies yet ypoty is phil foden logically apart from anything else this makes zero sense i wish someone could explain this to me sensibly without bs 🤷‍♂️ 
it was phil foden who won it last season 
total bs kevin db amp the total fraud phil foden should not even be in england team get player amp young player of the year bet pep gets manager of the year for choking champions league again choking fa cup again and potentially choking premier league by giving up 14 point lead 
would you like phil foden to celebrate a goal against us if he got transferred dont be mental 
assist phil foden mancity 5 aston villa 0 
i am 90 this year and think phil foden deserves this he will only get better it is a long time since i saw the likes of a young talent like him and what's more he comes from stockport like me 
just take a minute to take in the fact that phil foden has only played 27 games this season that is all 
first assist phil foden score mancity 4 1 aston villa 
dusting off my phil foden hazienda tee shirt and rewatching the final vs gillingham 1999 😎 
first assist bernardo silva first goal phil foden 
i am chelsea fan even though had more goal contribution than mount wasn't decisive in our two cup finals that is what caused him phil foden is more productive and as young as he is he makes more impact in big games than the other young players 
phil foden to assist game to end 2 0 in favour of mancity 
trent has offered more offensively and defensively than phil foden this season 😭😭 the fact that you have to bring in different players just proves my point understand this compared to foden trent has offered more on the pitch this season shitty fans for sure ared umb af😭 
before pep sterling never got more than 7 goals in a season john stones was considered a flop nobody had heard of phil foden kyle walker was benched by trippier and kevin de bruyne was a £60m flop do i need to go on 
ridiculous the number of goals scored nor assisted can't be the benchmark of selecting best players in seasons esp if those players aren't strikers with that said phil foden is more influential as a player than mason mount 
first assist phil foden final score mancity 1 aston villa 1 absagoalrush 
phil foden 7 10 i know it's mad rating him the same as mahrez but i think he deserves it been messed around all season changing his position yet has still performed does need to work on his finishing that's the only part of his game lacking 
yeah exactly that 😂 the spanish phil foden 
md 27 everton a 6 10 a good game to bounce back from after the loss to spurs a 0 1 away win was enough to get us over the line however we left it late to score as phil foden scored in the 82' minute 
that was not phil foden 😂 that was his brother 
md 9 brighton a 9 5 10 winning 1 4 away from home against a tough brighton side is impressive considering how good brighton have been this season phil foden with a brace aswell only thing is we conceded a preventable penalty 
why's phil foden there with pedri 
first assist phil foden🤞🏿 ft city 2 2 villa 
no ben he wasn't conor gallagher crystal palace mohamed salah liverpool trent alexander arnold liverpool kevin de bruyne manchester city phil foden manchester city declan rice west ham 
worse than that was phil foden getting ypoty 😂😂😂 
gutted that today will be antonio rudiger's last game with chelsea watched his video on youtube tonight not many players sit down and talk so openly about their career at chelsea will never forget that tackle in the ucl final on phil foden thank you toni ruediger 💙 
phil foden has performed in all games he played this season stop judging football by wicked stats 
mason mount over phil foden it is 
and he followed back again still won't make phil foden a worthy ypoty winner 
phil foden won the ypoty with 9 goals and 5 asissts in 27 games while rashford in the 19 20 season had 17 goals and 7 assist and was still denied ypoty 
if van dijk is so good why doesn't he have more goals that phil foden this season 
phil foden to assist or score jack grealish to be carded 
congratulations to the well deserved awards won by manchester city pair kevin de bruyne player of the year and phil foden young player of the year whose talents will be on display again as favourites for the league title this afternoon 
i think this is more of a city bias hence why phil ponch foden has won the youngsters award personally i wouldve given the young award to connor gallagher 
phil foden is a great player no buts yp of the season congrats phil well deserved

phil foden is a better player than mason mount trent alexander is a good player foden deserves the award he has been immense this season 
phil foden to assist or score jack grealish to be carded 
if you lose i will make phil foden sporting director 
who cares about what you think phil foden is gifted footballer so would rather give awards to people who do not win league for their team at the expense of actual winners don't just look at stats 
phil foden too i congratulation a prestigious award mancity so lucky you are a new generation you born for only champion 💙💙💙👍🤟👌🙏🙏🙏😍 
phil foden is probably the only person frm academy at city but u chose madrid btw vini rodrygo casemiro reiner jovic marcelo ramos werent known kroos nd modric bought very cheap carvajal frm academy u r jst talking trash 
5 minutes goal phil foden😂 
this kid has potential to be the next phil foden why loan him 
and how can phil foden get the premier league young player of the year where there was trent arnold reece james gallaghar mount saka 
phil foden is your average midfielder in spain take him out of that generational talk 
little phil foden 👏👏👏 
salah ofc they'll give it to the priemer league winners players such as phil foden which he a really didn't deserve because mount is clear 
😂 the lfc winge a thon agenda starts today…😂 let's begin with phil foden 😂 
phil foden is a great player but seeing him being named young player of the season sums up the problem with modern day awards a popularity contest nothing more nothing less trent saka rice amp mount would all have been more worthy winners 
man rest apart from goals and assists mason mount is far better than phil foden this season 
grealish o phil foden 
phil foden pretty damn good ngl 
bodied what you actually think this is real that's literally java eclipse or microsoft studio i can do the same and make foden phil be 1 000 000 votes 
phil foden doesn't deserve his award either tbh has to be money 
phil foden 9 goals 5 assists amp 1 motm mason mount 11 goals 10 assists amp 7 motm officaly fraud awards 
foden was main attacker without g a he impacted the game against both matches with chelsea united and liverpool our every players has not big amount of goals this season our top scorer is midfielder and phil foden has third most g a in our squad and we're on top make sense 
saka has had a g a against a top 6 side at the etihad more recently than phil foden and the same amount as foden all season at the etihad 
for everyone what would you do if you are real madrid probably invest in some youth program to get some players who can replace benzema modric will real madrid shift their focus on getting players like jude from bvb phil foden from city 
phil foden is great congrats 
ok let me set it straight phil foden is a good player but he isn't the best young player he is way over rated 
when they played man city phil foden looked a better player there's a lesson right there for them 
manchester city attacker phil foden awarded premier league young player of the season for second consecutive season he achieved the same number of goals and assists when he won the award last season 9 goals and 5 assists in 27 premier league appearances 
same here instead we signed jack clarke phil foden haircut with phil collins football abilities 
goals and assists dont mean everything big fella your saying you think mason mount is a better footballer than phil foden delusional 
phil foden runs onto the pitch on 70 minutes each week and ends up being crowned pl young player of the year 🤷🏻‍♂️ 
i don't agree was the premier league guys because bukayo saka had good season done phil foden 
we liverpool fans didn't complain about this but you're complaining about phil foden's own🤫🤫 
breaking trent alexander arnold has won the ypoty via samuellfc's opinion phil foden has been instructed to return the trophy immediately 
for me i no that phil foden his good player but for me i vote bukayo saka for the good job he managed to do to our team arsenal by scoring more goals this season and his our top scorer of this season and his goals are y we are in number 5 this season 
we have had a overlooked squad friendship with ben davies referring to sonny as his best mate on insta can you please comment on how this fits into the storied history of spurs besties 
i feel like we should extend firmino's contract beyond 2023 the following should have their contracts renewed salah firmino mane keita milner van den berg the following should be sold ox taki ben davies nat phillips rhyd williams what do people think 
ben davies and dier too defensively sound during the run in 
but ben davies and bentancur are 
admit it you didn't expect to see ben davies in the replies 
ben davies squad no 22 appearances 22 goals 1 clean sheets 7 sufc twitterblades 
upgrade the first team and players like ben davies who has been quality will do a great job off the bench or in cup games or league aswell for example bastoni would be an incredible upgrade to the squad and gives us good depth at the same time thfc 
yeah ben davies should just be a lcb in a back 3 it's his best position don't wanna see him at lwb or even lb 
davies 7 5 10 another player in our team who had to adjust to a new role ben moved from being a left back to a center back in conte's system and he proved himself worthy of his starting spot well done davies 
ben davies has been brilliant every club needs a ben davies model pro 
ben davies again one of my favorite players for spurs ever for some reason i love the guy and this season he put all the haters to bed tucked them in with their teddy bears after giving them some warm milk and they slept well for 9 months rating 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 
just know he's out of contract as it stands i've said he reminds me of ben davies when he first came in get him a full season of men's football under his belt and think he'll really improve plus he's left footed which is always a bonus 😅 
of course this show was going to be fun but what a great sendoff into summer look forward to transfer shows hope ben davies stays as a squad player but whoever replaces him better have his master's honours degree coys lwos 
look at ben davies💉💉💉 
how many of us would have sold ben davies and eric dier in the summer i'd have certainly been open to it matt doherty emerson royal amp ryan sessegnon have been written off by many mid season and then all have ultimately showed their value once they've found their flow 
maldini is just the italian ben davies 
md points but for the vast majority of the decisions i'd make them again ie min doubts like dias ben davies dcl suboptimal planning has also caused a few losses which i've learned from and hope to avoid next season thanks to everyone i've interacted with been a blast ♥️ 
ben the rock davies just stopping norwich in their attack 😂 
starting the season with nuno thinking kane would leave thinking we would just dissolve into mid table somehow getting conte expecting conte to leave after burnley to 4th what a season leicester away fav game ben davies deserves more credit 
some of the very crucial ben davies blocks vs leeds a vs liverpool a vs arsenal h 
well said add ben davies and he's goal too 
i remember when spurs fans complained because we gave ben davies a new contract one of our best players this season fans are fickle 
now is not the day for it so i won't today is a happy day but in 10 years ben davies has been good for 4 months ngl 
ben davies 200 iq play he knew he had to sacrifice that goal 
ben davies blocking shots left right and centre deserves massive credit the most underrated defender we've had in years 
but not anyone can make ben davies play like prime maldini 
have a lovely evening ben zonar 😂😂 
ben davies 8 what a season speaking only under conte since he didn't really play under nuno he's been a strong defender particularly great at blocks and is an integral part of the team in possession has shown great character too very pleased with ben this year 
from liverpool draw in december i don't remember taking this but apparently ben davies almost scored 
ben davies 7 10 didn't do much early on but has been a key player since conte's arrival change in system did him wonders 
big shoutout to kukusevski amp bentacur who were a massive upgrade and i can't believe how fantastic ben davies has become son is incredible kane is incredible everyone else absolutely knows their job and has done it really well a few exits a few signings and we can 🏆 
it's not over until ben davies scores ⚽ 
bloody awful keeper expensive loan signings aren't always the answer look at olsen and to a lesser extent ben davies robinson and bash are both better for utd i'm not saying better players but it's a team game and in our team he's not as good also lightweight physically 
nah he's been amazing but bentancur has been instrumental in the conte system best signing of the window was whoever made ben davies learn what defending was 
so as much as i want son to score a goal you have to respect how much ben davies has grown under conte 
solid 7 10 player every game has always been given a hard time but you know what you are going to get with ben davies 
ben davies elite shot blocker 
ben davies with crucial defensive actions yet again what a man 
you support a club with a really good future bro dw i think you'll get too 4 next season eric dier and ben davies at the back ain't gonna work for long 
lost count how many great blocks ben davies has made this season playing so well 
ben davies to score 
ben davies' shin guard is so wholesome 
winks has to go…ben davies needs upgrading 
1 virgil van dijk 2 joel matip 3 joe gomez 4 fabinho 1st pick replacement 5 henderson 1st pick replacement 6 ozan kabak panic buy replacement 7 ben davies another panic buy replacement 8 billy koumetio under 21s up stepped 9 nat phillips 10 rhys williams 
walking penis and bollocks for legs tom davies and calvert lewin gear that 
thought this was about ben davies for a sec 💀 
when reading your 2 novels i imagined these actors in the tv drama elizabeth helen mirren joyce julia mckenzie ron ray winstone ibrahim ben kingsley stephen jim broadbent bogdan sacha baron cohen donna letitia wright chris greg davies make it happen 🙏 
i own kane kulu and ben davies 
will you wear a ben davies shirt if we do it 🤣 
it's definitely is cl quality spurs will be rocking up with eric dier ben davies and davinson sanchez to ucl nights our center half's are quality just need a stable midfield and full backs for a season and you'll see 
yup i'm here 
zebbin ben davies backstick 
wales have a good crop of young second rows developing with the likes of price rhys davies and ben carter 
alex davies been banged up here for been a nazi' but our government supporting our brothers in ukraine alex and ben should be let out now 
he would fit that lcb spot in conte's three man defence instead of ben davies perfectly but €60m but inter are great at selling 
awful idea i'd rather start ben davies 
sell ben davies to give fabio 28 give diaz the 7 and keep jota at 20 
pierre emile højbjerg the warrior the viking 36 38 matches played vital cog in our midfield always running always there critical for covering in davies' spot when davies pushes up very important rating 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 
pierre emile højbjerg 6 hard player to asses first half of the season was mostly poor he frustrated me to no end off and specially on the ball but 2nd half of the season he's possibly been our most underrated player he's picked up similar stance to bentancur for the future 
pierre emile højbjerg 5 10 very average good at breaking up play doesn't do anywhere near enough with the ball only does half the job

if he's to come can he please have a different number 9 isn't a good one lacazette lucas perez baptista podolski eduardo reyes rip 
perez had no chance anyway 
madrid won't deter rodrygo's progress that position isn't a priority really cancelo amp james wil cost a fortune amp perez won't splash such ridiculous amount on right back for sure lucas vasquez amp carvajal have covered the position well we should go for barella if we don't want pogba

will you be the chauffeur for dani alves 
who is a better defender dani alves or trent 
so if elanga wins a trophy next season or even god forbid maguire then suddenly they're good players so dani alves is the greatest player ever 
and dani alves 
dani alves needs to retire from barca end of story with him 
i haven't seen that one i saw the dani alves one saying pep didn't like the one twos he played on the sidelines in the middle of the pitch with messi but alves did it anyway lol 
if he renews dani alves then i'm xaviout‼️ 
😂the problem is dani alves will still be our main rb along with roberto and 32 yr azpi crosses after crosses and zero tracking back to defend 
•nothing to fight for only araujo had the spirit •dani alves is a liability at the back araujo bails him out majority of the time • adama assist 
i think it's a high time we do away with the get the ball pass the ball of a thing 😡😡 why can't our players play shots from outside the box like dani alves did we the fans are really angry right now almost all the big teams won their last matches today 
sign a good fullback for once can't play week and week out with 65 year old dani alves 
its 2022 not 2016 dani alves is finished 
dont compare dani alves to dest ir minguenza because dani alves is better in many ways he doesnt have the dame physical then before 
it's clear what problems are left amp right backs a backup defensive midfielder amp ferran question to trading away f de jong to get lewandowski absolutely but we must keep pierre not adama but where the hell was dani alves the rightback check the video 🤔 
dani alves is the weak link we need a to improve the rb position 
it's purely dani alves fault he's too heavy to track back 
araujó on the first place pedri is the second however here are our problems traore braithwaite umtiti lenglet puig mingueza luuk de jong dani alves ousmane dembelé pjanic griezmann memphis neto laporta's usual 2nd year cleaning job dest no frenkie nooo 
🤣😂😂 speak for your players not the other team's players how about alba or busquets there's dani alves fa 
dani alves and busquets are a disgrace to the team 
i know why it's not possible to change busi alva pique yet stegen dani alves straight away right you need to have some players with more experience a balance the season is what it is wait for the summer window and then complain they've done great this winter wait 
dani alves said they were peaking at the right time 🤣🤣 
exactly why he was always left up top 🤣 the amount he had to track back today cus of dani alves going walkies was ridiculous he just hasn't got this defensive stuff in his locked 🤣 
dani alves and busquets are a disgrace to the team 
dani alves and busquets are a disgrace to the team 
how bad must mingueza be in training for dani alves to still be the no 1 pick at right back with performances like this 
where was dani alves when villarreal scored 
chill xavi didn't even have one summer transfer window and he had one winter transfer where we struggled to register torres and had to sign a dani alves who is playing on minimum wages 
adama traore set up for failure twice by dani alves barca are never serious when alves is playing 
we really need to be honest about dani alves defensively 
please don't renew dani alves contract 😩 
you can't tuck dani alves in the midfield and expect adama to attack and defend at the same time yes he's not that good but xavi was asking too much 
where is dani alves he should be getting that ball 
i wouldn't primarily blame adama he is not a rb and shouldn't constantly be mopping after dani alves mistakes are just bound to happen at this point which is sad because he did try to create opportunities 
adama only did that because dani alves was nowhere to be found whats not to understand are you just that dense 
dani alves should not be renewed i'd rather have roberto playing rn 
adama and dani alves out 
make nobody lie you we fuckin suck gavi is all hype ferran isn't up there don't get me started on dani alves 
dani alves today playing midfielder xavi and his pensioner friends 
definitely dani alves gerard pique and jordi alba are well north of 30 eric garcia is a midfielder in a defender's body clement lenglet is a dumb error waiting to happen samuel umtiti is always injured and xavi doesn't seem to trust sergino dest 
look at more than half the goals or chances we concede and which side they come from dani alves is a massive liability 
dani alves oh wait 
dani alves joining the midfield is always a disaster he is the only rb in the team who does that why does xavi allow that cos that leaves spaces at our right side of defence for opposition to exploit 
dani alves thinks he is still 21😭😭 he need to stay at his post fff 
dani alves very good attacker 
auba 🚮🚮 ferran 🚮🚮 dani alves out of position all gavi does is collect yellow cards 🤣🤣 we need a full squad revamp 
dani alves needs to retire 
dani alves has no clue what he's doing 
if alves wasn't in the fucking midfield it wouldn't be adamas man to mark shit is stupid araujo has to do extra work on the right side which tires him out why can't dani alves be a normal right back like every other rb in europe 
unlike dani alves who just decides to play in midfield whenever he wants to 
no matter who we buy in thr attack it will be a terrible transfer window if we sell dest and renew dani alves but this isn't a sunday league club where you can hope for game time and to to prepare yourself for the world cup on the expense of the club 
dani alves is the deficiency atm only one good cross and he's not fast enough to recover 
dani alves is on vacation lol 
no he has conceded almost every first shot on him this season dani alves should have been there and adama too but what is this positioning man and he doesn't even move 
i hope we can get azpi so that the order for rb will be dest azpi roberto and then dani alves if he renews 
any game dani alves plays means barca isn't serious about winning 
dani alves is just vibing and giving dead crosses still the goat rb tho but damn he's old 
this dani alves inverted rb role is so dumb considering he's slow as hell and will never get back in position quick enough 
we can't compete at the high level with a finished dani alves as our left back 
i agree with a million times dani alves is a realiabilty and cant be trusted going forward 
better defender than lenglet amp dani alves combined 
the nostalgia feeling we have with dani alves will be the downfall of us 
dani alvesa positioning just pisses me the fuck off why can't he just be a normal right back like wtf it just tires out araujo 
dani alves fault he is just roaming everywhere on the pitch 
ferran and dani alves are horrible 
dani alves just got lost on the pitch 
dani alves doesn't want to defend adama can not defend nor attack tbh 
dani alves ghosting adama literally had to go close him down 
dani alves a long way out of the picture there 
wtf was dani alves doing 
don't renew dani alves 
we're screwed with jordi alba and dani alves as our full backs in the ucl 
where tf is dani alves 
we're screwed with jordi alba and dani alves as our full backs in the ucl 
this is why dani alves should be a 3rd option not the first 
where the hell is dani alves 
we're screwed with jordi alba and dani alves as our full backs in the ucl 
dani alves 🤮 literally shit fullbacks 
where tf is dani alves lol 
blame dani alves 
gotta love dani alves😭 
warra imagine mbappe vs dani alves next season award for vardrid 
cafu and dani alves praise trent and probably don't even know who james is😭😭😭 
bro he inherited a team with toure puyol xavi iniesta henry eto and messi he signed dani alves and gerard pique you don't need to spend a lot if you have that lot 
might sell dani alves for porro tots 500k difference and isn't much in it thoughts chap 
dani alves rate trent as one of the best except the manager and fans of england lol vvd can slip once and it is celebrated like a title win much more can be said talked about anything that a player does is over analysed and critiqued yet one of the best managers 
i think the last full back i saw who was as athletic as bassey would be dani alves but he was only half the size i'd play at left back until his pace goes and then he just becomes a mountain of a centre half 
you guys are talking like we have a dani alves in the team smh 
sergino dest vs realmadrid 1080p the next dani alves 
dani alves with 42 you're welcome 👍🏾 
lol dani alves a barca player has more trophy then your club liverpool and you still think you can chat to barcelona 
forgot to talk about dani alves 200k rise on him legendary investment 
bcoz we are in epl the best league itw and dani alves never play there 
is dani alves a joke to you 😒😒 
so it is also only special players that scores anyways most full backs bang in assist every season marcelo dani alves alba arnold cancelo and many more 
selling releasing sergi roberto lenglet umtiti braithwaite adama neto puig dani alves buying signing kessie kounde left back right back raphinha dembele collado iñaki peña christensen final lineup 
loosing to frankfurt ain't shit but real madrid who lost to sheriff but won liga and are in the cl final is more embarrassing according to twitter dot com user dha anarchist and mfs talking about pull you're literally pulling 34 year old and 39 year dani alves to your team 😭😭 
🤣🤣🤣 trents completed all major trophies aged 23 got numerous records that he has broken gets landed by the likes of cafu and dani alves reece james has what champs league and no records he's good but not on trents level 
dani alves has only 3 more messi will surpass him this year finalissima trophee des champions world cup and if he happens to win just one of these 3… next season psg will win at least 3 trophies 
ask cafu and dani alves he'll tell u who has transformed that position in english football honestly speaking 
maybe but i think messi suarez neymar dani alves have bigger ego than this psg team 
is it it's showing as a friendly match between copa winners and euro winners as of now but hey couldn't say no to a trophy now that we're closing in on dani alves 
dani alves did this countless times while at barca la liga didn't complain apart from ffp they can go to hell 
my man is flexing with trophy count he only care dani alves trophy count 
rb like ramos dani alves at rb also felt like a no brainer cuz he's easily the greatest rb of all time it's not even a debate 
the only tireless runners in that 11 were dani alves and jordi alba abeg nobody else was a runner they won by pure class and tactical brilliance 
dani alves said taa is the best cafu too has compared taa and himself brazilians know ball more than these thwarts who've been comparing any player they can think of 
is that your excuse for no argument to curse him out messi always drifted infield to play with the midfield not with his rb in dani alves so get your facts right 
dani alves is very expensive 
dani alves is very expensive 
dani alves is very expensive 
dani alves for sure 
he already has more trophies than every player except dani alves 
sergi roberto is very potential player when used in midfield he never was a right back he was forced to fill that void specially after dani alves left 
my point still stands bringing team trophies in individual debate is irrelevant thats like saying dani alves is the greatest footballer of all time🤣 
you don't even have trophy more than dani alves 
no he couldn't according to la liga rules messi can't even play with 50 salary coz his market value was so high at that moment after 7 th b'dor and many other reasons he can't play like dani alves 
bias aside he's the best full back this generation …i know he feels motivated and proud of his effort when cafu and dani alves say he's the best in that position 
messi could've stayed and play the way that dani alves plays for barca 
riqui earns less than 2 mil and roberto earns like 7mil almost the same as kimmich and vandijk and his contract ends this summer could have gotten 7 mil off the wage bill but no if dest leaves roberto 40 yr old dani alves and 32 yr old azpilicueta 🤦‍♂️ 
the man's 37 and was asked to play right back when he's a dm were you expecting prime dani alves 
fuck this shit where's dani alves 
you have one club trying to attract high profile wonder kids and another signing dani alves and lewandoski looking for new sensations is this still the highest rivalry in football 😂 
tbf our goat team regardless of impact for the club is like top 3 with real madrid and barcelona and i'm sure we're not 3rd we can boast messi neymar mbappe ronaldinho zlatan beckham dani alves makelele ect 
your two best players averaged 14 full matches of football itl and you got 60 points and were geronimo rulli away from a cl final 
raul albiol blocks a memphis shot in the final minute of stoppage time and it's over franco 102 ryan 101 
2 2 it's funny how many people don't realize that in south texas ice and border patrol employees are likely to have names like lopez and martinez 
david lopez's version of laura looks nothing like she hulk or thor 
i really loved the way that david lopez drew laura in all new wolverine she was short but she was built she was looked like someone you wouldn't want to tangle with after lopez left the book she went back to looking like a skinny waif again

the emotion and sentiment in this response is out of this world did javier pastore not vacate the same 10 to neymar on his arrival yes he did did naymar offer messi the 10 shirt yes he did so why are you making a big deal of it 
guy you capping nonsense big time nonsense raul didn't wear the jersey till he retire casillas too figo carlos guti figo even ronaldo delima is a madrid legend and many more player didn't retire wearing madrid jersey but they're madrid legends but you just wanna cap shit

in jest not in jeer milan is red manchester is blue tickets to turkey booked hakan calhanoglu 
dedicated to hakan calhanoglu 😀😀😀 
so proud of hakan the traitor calhanoglu 😂😂😂 
please everyone lets laugh at hakan calhanoglu he left milan for inter to win the leageu🤣 
hakan çalhanoğlu 2020 2021 finished 2nd in serie a with ac milan behind inter milan 2021 2022 moved to inter milan and finished 2nd in serie a behind ac milan xd 
🎙️ hakan çalhanoglu last december ac milan have quality players but there are better ones here inter have a superior squad 🥶🥶🥶

hakan calhanoglu left milan after getting 2nd place for rivals inter just to finish 2nd again 😂 
hakan calhanoglu left to win the tittle 
how i feel i feel sick and wanna scream in front of hakan kebab calhanoglu and gigi dollaruma 
nah because of hakan calhanoglu i wan ac milan to win this scudetto 
what if nahuel molina on the right 
udinese tonight are deployed in a back three formation with ilija nestorovski joining gerard deulofeu as a strike pair set to lead on breaks nahuel molina and destiny udogie a reliable wingback duo with jean victor makengo and roberto pereyra ahead of walace 0️⃣ 0️⃣ seriea 
at the rwb spot the two players you've already signalled look great being djed spence and nahuel molina both have problems with spence being the stronger defensive player of the two while molina has the most goals from wingback in world football this season 
hickey will compete with tierney while either norton cuffy depending on how he performs in preseason or nahuel molina if we swap for marí will compete with tomiyasu 
cup just went flying and nearly hits jean victor makengo if that connects with the udinese midfielder their side could well have faced a points deduction and therefore relegated whatever happens what a thick thing to do salernitanaudinese

disappointment 1 kalulu not scoring the winner against juventus diaz switches the play leading to a huge chance needs to be in the back of the net from pierre kalulu juventus had taken only 1 point from their opening 3 and we had a chance to pile on the misery shame

mattia caldara too bad he's horse shit irl 
if i were closer to frank lampard i'll ask him to sign barkley amp ethan ampadu and take vale on loan 
alot of people under the cs don't watch other leagues yet have the most to say if your favourite big accounts start hyping the boy then you'd fall in line like you don't have a mind of your own ethan ampadu is a baller amp i hope he gets his chance next season 🤞 
how's ethan ampadu done at venezia please gab most reports i've seen have been fairly positive considering tough season for the team 
ethan ampadu is someone i will definitely have in the squad next year the guy has a underated season i underestimated him because of his season last season but it's kind of like gilmours season this season both are good players playing for bad teams
