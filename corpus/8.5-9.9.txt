goal arsenal 3 1 everton cedric soares arseve 
if cedric soares plays a single second for arsenal next season i'm glueing my eyes together in an act of political protest 
i can't be in each amp every pics without ending the season with a goal 🤩🤩🤩cedric soares 
cédric soares makes it 3 1 for arsenal giving away another plinusa mug for each of these fans 👇 myplmorning 
goal what an outstanding goal a very smart corner from bukayo saka finds its way to cédric soares who smashes home an unbelievable shot and surely puts the game beyond all reasonable doubt 🔴⚪️ 3 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
arsenal 3 1 everton 56' cedric soares arseve 
goal 3 1 cedric soares leathers in from saka's short corner with everton asleep proper final day occurrence 
a fantastic cross from cédric soares almost falls to granit xhaka but the swiss international midfielder just not quick enough to get there 🔴⚪️ 2 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
cédric soares and rob holding are good subs for a team who not have much money to spend nuno tavares was a waste of money 
who's an arteta type footballer aside cedric soares 
when you say he didn't sign him what do you mean 
we should see if his loan spell at betis hepled him because before his loan he was arguably worse than cedric soares 
cedric soares 
🙋🏾‍♂️being one of them lokonga tavares cedric soares nketiah lacazette elneny pablo mari who else do we have out on loan 
how did they manage to bottle the champions league dream in that position how do they lose every must win match how do they have cedric fucking soares as a back up right back how do they have so many players injured even though they barely play cup games how

james or maddison that's the question 
sounds like james is benched have 3 spurs already so james to sess and kulu to one of maddison bowen mount diaz for 4 
gameweek thirty eight gw38 team transfers 3 8 pts out james alonso amp brownhill in sess white amp maddison captain kane 4 5 1 this wk fpl fplcommunity gw38 or 82k just hope to get in top 91k for a top 1 finish season has really went bad last few weeks 
option 1 kulu salah out for son cap and maddison option 2 davis and salah out for sessegnon and son bench james assuming not starting option 3 salah to mane cap on kane option 4 salah to kdb 
rotation possible on maddison and james i have both as well 
touch choices james mane is a great differential punt to shoot you up the ranks son is a huge rank damager and the big captain fav the safer option i like maddison or mount hope we get team leaks 
4 to end the season with james in for cash and maddison in for gordon bb active on final day 
there'll be a sending off at arsenal son will score a hatrick de bruyne will score chelsea will win 3 0 liverpool wil win 4 0 james maddison will score brighton west ham will be a draw ten hag will resign before he even starts artetas a nonce norwich are inbreeding specialist

1 define an assault rifle 2 james maddison's letter about cannons on private ships 
james maddison higher upside and better pick imo but only if they start i think rudiger mount is safer option in terms of xmins 
maddison has scored 14 goals so far from outside the penalty area in the premier league since his debut in the competition in august 2018 only james ward prowse 15 goals has scored more than him in this period 🔥✅

we can't win premier league depending on other teams we have to win on our own for that liverpool should overhaul the midfield very little creativity fsg should loosen their purse strings sign some world class midfielders like kevin de bruyne 
from these last 3 tweets i have concluded that adam is a fan of the star soccer player kevin de bruyne

thoughts on kevin de bruyne 
not a man city fan but i marvel at kevin de bruyne's game 
city take the lead newly crowned player of the season kevin de bruyne threads the ball to i̇lkay gündoğan to tap in the goal that quite possibly wins the league 
kevin de bruyne that it that the hero 
that's what happens when you play for the late game when they've got the ultimate carry hero kevin de bruyne he just needs that aghs that unlocks amazing assist then it's gg 
or not now kevin de bruyne is pretty good isn't he 
what a massive assist from kevin de bruyne though he's been rubbish all game long and then pulls that out the bag god damn 
penalty 85 min kevin de bruyne and he scuffs it come back to this tweet 
my man kevin de bruyne you have got to be a leader 
we need to have a talk about kevin de bruyne 
more league assists in 3 and a half months than player of the year kevin de bruyne has in the whole season 👀 
kulusevski has more premier league assists than player of the year kevin de bruyne kulusevski has only been playing just over 3 months 
if we lose kevin de bruyne and phil foden should be stripped their premier legue play of the season awards it will be a sham 
kevin de bruyne is an attacking midfielder right if so then he's a forward too because he's always found and supposed to be in the attacking third i stand to be corrected anyway 
😭😭😭😭 thought you were talking about kevin de bruyne for some reason 
kevin de bruyne player of the season your team needs you 
kevin de bruyne your club needs you 
they have been to be fair but there are only so many kevin de bruyne's on the market 
de bruyne is the most important here i want to play like never before ferna is going to get humilated by coutinho hands down only kevin assists can save us for today 
i respect ur opinion but this is the premier league player of the season and kevin de bruyne has been integral to man citys title run depending on who wins the league 
kevin de bruyne is an elite player who had a great season and will go down as the greatest ever midfielder to ever play in the pl but he didn't deserve that award neither did he deserve last season's pfa poty award point blank period 💯 
gerrards greatest moment in football history was the day he was compared with kevin de bruyne 
kevin de bruyne to score anytime josh brownhill to be carded 
is that kevin de bruyne in a united shirt 
first assist kevin de bruyne and scores will be 4 1 at least 😁 
premier league player of the year kevin de bruyne has not been named player of the month all this season in the premier league 
man city win amp kevin de bruyne 1 shots on target 
that's why i said once you have a good player in assisting then the team is going higher they have the highest contributions in a game watch kevin de bruyne 
so they still lost the league guess who wins it kevin de bruyne i e player of the year think about it… 
before pep sterling never got more than 7 goals in a season john stones was considered a flop nobody had heard of phil foden kyle walker was benched by trippier and kevin de bruyne was a £60m flop do i need to go on 
don't you have access to better stats than just goals and assists a great season still loved sonny's season more an absolute assassin this season 
1 kevin de bruyne 2 benfica's number 9 i forgot his name 3 federico chiesa 4 theo hernandez 5 reece james 
kevin de bruyne 8 5 10 not a great start but when he got going he's basically single handedly taken us to 1 win for the title business end of the season big players step up amp that's what he has done 
he's no kevin de bruyne for the salary and transfer fees we stupidly paid 
so kevin de bruyne had an impact all over the pitch while salah had it at the front 
for me it is also that kevin de bruyne is the better than mo salah that's what i say as a chelsea fan and i hope that mancity will be mastered and not liverpool 
salah phenomenal for liverpool since august 2021 floppy the last few weeks kevin de bruyne phenomenal for mancity the last few weeks mostly injured first few months of the season epl best player kdb 🤔 
we have lowered these personal glory to only goals goals n assists i think it's time to recognize players like jordan henderson micheal carrick de bruyne fabinho fernandinho etc players that play different positions for the good of the team kevin de bruyne deserved it 
i think salah deserve better to have taken what was given to kevin de bruyne all the same no problem at all the future is very bright

sadio mane amp kevin de bruyne each to have over 1 shot on target was 3 1 6 1 as long as they both play i thought this decent value on w hill good luck today pleased with yesterday as i switched the juve game to 1 5 goals 
no ben he wasn't conor gallagher crystal palace mohamed salah liverpool trent alexander arnold liverpool kevin de bruyne manchester city phil foden manchester city declan rice west ham 
wright not because it's turgid or boring it's not being disrespectful to city but teams are so afraid they have to do those blocks and they have to do the deep block to stop them because we've seen kevin de bruyne bam bam bam the game's over 
kevin de bruyne seeing that city need to win👀 
rumours of kevin de bruyne's decline in the first half of the season were very exaggerated he started just 5 pl games due to an ankle injury covid up until december 14th his record since then 28 goals assists in 27 starts all comps he was always still a world class player 
theirs always going to be a debate but i think the right man won although any of the three could of won thats how good the three have been this season especially kevin de bruyne and mo salah 
kevin de bruyne literally stepped it up a level scoring a hattrick in 25 mins against wolves to keep them top of the league the man is an unreal footballer having watched both pool and city at molineux liverpool have no one near de bruynes quality

salah trent jarod bowen mount robertson harvey barnes pogba michail antonio jesus reece james kane kulusevski all of them have more assists than kevin de bruyne stats aren't everything but for a creative mid assists are important 
salah trent jarod bowen mount robertson harvey barnes pogba michail antonio jesus reece james kane kulusevski what do all these players have in common they all have more assists than kevin de bruyne nonsense award 
point is he played for madrid one of the best attacking team but he never managed to go beyond 25 goals involvement why because nobody cared for his goals involvement he was dominating the pitch same kevin de bruyne does dictate the match 
acting like we don't have kevin de bruyne 
kevin de bruyne is a thief who doesn't deserve the best player in city damn the fa and damn the bias of modernity 
🗣️ kevin de bruyne i think my performances have been good and i am happy i have been able to contribute with goals and assists throughout the season 3 4 
🗣️ kevin de bruyne there is so much quality in the premier league and it is a pleasure to be nominated with so many other great players who have had incredible seasons for their clubs… 2 4 
actually it's worth giving a mention to rodrigo bentancur as well those january signings have been key to transforming tottenham's season 
rodrigo bentancur helped us get champions league been unreal 8 
rodrigo bentancur has been that critical playmaker tidy passer we needed to enable our attackers to actually attack so calm under pressure it's like nobody is even there excited for him to have a full season rating 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 
wait you mean rodrigo bentancur and dejan kulusevski were not serious signings but cast offs do you know what spurs signed in january and players just wait and see what arteta will do this summer enjoy your moment cause it ain't gonna last 
🎶he's the reason we'll be playing on wednesday next season he came with his mate from sweden rodrigo bentancur 🎶 
london he's brought in gems in rodrigo bentancur amp dejan kulusevski that have elevated his side towards uefa champions league football antonio conte has worked wonders 🙌🇮🇹 
rodrigo bentancur 7 while i'm not a fan of him as a player i think he's severely lacking giving him a bad rating when we've been good with him playing would be too harsh he's looked garbage average and rlly good at many different points but overall a positive influence ig 
rodrigo bentancur 6 10 good first impression bought a lot of control and composure to the midfield 
hessss the reason we'll be playing on tuesdays next season…he came with his mate from sweden rodrigo bentancur 
rodrigo bentancur first half vs norwich 59 touches 96 pass completion 50 completed passes 2 key passes 100 successful crosses 2 big chances created 100 ground duels won 3 interceptions 2 tackles 2 assists so far so good thfc are 45 mins away from the ucl coys nortot

second verse paritici signed him with dier davies romero behind him he's a top class uruguayan rodrigo bentancur 
first pic is heung min son and last pic is dejan kulusevski 
kulusevski 9 10 14 starts 8 assists 5 goals 13 contributions £35 million let the numbers do the talk for dejan 
dejan kulusevski words can't begin to describe his impact 5 goals 8 assists in 18 matches wow really feels like he's the missing piece of the son kane player front 3 almost perfectly complements both of them rating 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 
they had a poll that had demand kulusevski instead of dejan lmao 
wait you mean rodrigo bentancur and dejan kulusevski were not serious signings but cast offs do you know what spurs signed in january and players just wait and see what arteta will do this summer enjoy your moment cause it ain't gonna last 
always believed in dejan kulusevski 
dejan kulusevski couldn't passed the ball 3 metres away with juventus yet he helped tottenham to the get champions league spot under the correct manager serie a players could do something in epl easily 
dejan kulusevski with juventus this season in serie a 20 appearances 1 goal 3 assists dejan kulusevski under antonio conte in the premier league 18 appearances 5 goals 8 assists 
dejan kulusevski and him really galvanized son's and kane's efforts this season nice to see them getting a taste of success after all they've been through 
london he's brought in gems in rodrigo bentancur amp dejan kulusevski that have elevated his side towards uefa champions league football antonio conte has worked wonders 🙌🇮🇹 
dejan kulusevski 7 10 mighty impressive since his arrival really balances out our front 3 and was a big reason we'll be playing champions league next season

speaks better english than harry kane 
we ate gonna get in the champions league next season because we are gonna get rid of our losers and buy world class from now on… buy harry kane even if he costs £150 milli 
you can be a great player without winning the league we now saying okazaki is better than harry kane because he won the league and kane hasn't 
he won it before harry kane 
praise sonny without mentioning harry kane challenge failed 
i absolutely love the guy he has won everywhere he has been i'm just worried about keeping him and harry kane who is your team 
there is a kid in development who everyone wants broja is decent in attack but that too much pressure too soon if we buy maybe harry kane who knows the epl i don't like risking it i hope vale gets minutes 
son is among the most criminally underrated footballers in pl history he's what the english press would have u believe harry kane is if his name was stephen maguire they would've said only pele might be marginally better in fact son amp kdb are the only pl players worth gt £70m 
harry kane is 28 and runs like my grandma and son hasn't done much since world cup sooo 
doesn't get the recognition he deserves because he plays for spurs and most times harry kane takes the spotlight but he's fucking good 
did you well next time make it clear mate this ain't harry kane your talking about who's won absolutely nothing in his career 
lol why do you think i sent it to you harry kane the hurricane 
i've done the math since 14 15 tottenham has spent a total of 57 200 000 on harry kane's failure 
i will better say city has it own way because last season harry kane was the top assist and goalscorer still they gave it to ruben diaz 
harry kane could've helped win it alone but nigga is too greedy 
folk need to stop getting a massive stauner over harry kane he's never won anything and tottenham are pish 
spurs used it to blood fringe players most notably harry kane not sure who they will be with united but 
harry kane is such a jerk he could have given pk's to sonny from bronx tale no wonder harry doesn't win anything 🤔 
good thing you switched camps otherwise you'd never win a premier league title just wish harry kane had the common sense to leave tottenham so he could get one also but if he wants to put pride before trophies it's his career 
he's done it again that harry kane that f dirty bastard 
no harry kane jack grealish harry maguire or luke shaw 
makes me wonder what is harry kane's plan 
he did more then harry kane 
find harry kanes shot goal stat because i can tell you now it's worse i know kane scores for fun but him shots goals is horrendous 
got plenty of space about him as well klopp type of player will press as well if harry kane could press i would say kane but too slow 
you should have harry kane as your dp seeing you're a spurs fan 
we got loads of things we can hold on too been seen won many things unlike your lot literally not won a thing absolutely shit poor old harry kane all them goals and ya ya sanogoo gonna end with more honours 
it is insane how much difference 12 months can make last year they lost the final game and everyone thought harry kane was leaving now all people can talk about is who they're gonna sign next season football is a thing of beauty 
harry kane late winner vs city or stevie b's last minute double against your foxes… both elicited loud screams of joyous oh my god 
i wounder what harry kane thinking right now 🥲 
our two indisputably world class players pictured here alongside harry kane 
kane 8 10 started the season with 1 goal in his 13 first games to ending it with 16 goals amp 9 assists in his last 24 what a turnaround for harry kane 
harry kane it's just harry kane 9 5 
more goals and assists than your boy harry kane 👀 
did harry kane take the picture 
if we had harry kane and son i'm sure we'd be up there stop then nonsense 
spurs' dramatic victory at the etihad harry kane's brace was ecstatic🤩🤩 i never thought spurs could do the double over the pl champions wow 🤤 
feeling sorry for harry kane 
even if you were harry kane mike dean would have given you a red card just for that comment 
harry kane is not happy 
one of those gentlemen snl agreements that harry kane knows only too well about 
only harry kane makes sense 
always in the right places harry kane won't have half of this 
goalkeeper of the season ramsdale defender of the season rudiger midfielder of the season kdb striker of the season harry kane coach of the season eddie howe flop of the season player mctominay useless club of the season man united 
bet they'd swop the 20 of the 22 goals they scored against norwich and leeds for harry kane to score 2 against real madrid to put them 4 up in that first leg though 😉 
harry kane and son left the group 
this was supposed to be harry kane 
jack grealish has won the pl title before harry kane 
come back to me when harry kane can say a sentence without getting spit on the floor mate 
not all about goals and assist…kdb was the key that turned the man city offense he's the best player in the epl without a doubt harry kane led both of those categories last season and he didn't win player of the year either 🤷🏻‍♂️ 
harry kane he's one of our own his head was turned this summer and that no doubt impacted his performances early on but bah gawd he's back and to his full form both the best 10 in the world and the best 9 in the world rating 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 
tottenham clinched champions league qualification with a 5 0 win over relegated norwich in the last round of the premier league 
your mum has touched more trophies than harry kane in recent times 😂 
still take them goals away you'll still be championship who's arguing i'm revelling here wednesday nights under the lights champions league conte at the helm and a washed up harry kane leading the line enjoy playing at hogsmead 
sore loser they have harry kane england needs them in the cl 
harry kane red card vs liver penalt ct vs everton etc 
goalkeeper of the season allison defender of the season thiago sliva midfielder of the season kdb striker of the season harry kane coach of the season thomas tuchel flop of the season player jack grelish useless club of the season manchester united 
harry kane is tom brady 
harry kane under mourinho did same last season 
harry kane and boderline gt coys 
forgot to add harry kane golden shoe for 2021 
breaking news jack grealish plays for a better team than harry kane 
harry kane has a golden duck 0⃣ 
the question on everybody's lips both hugely complimentary so i feel like i can't offend and yet am treading carefully i'm going to say charlie is sonny and you are harry kane just because you might have half an eye on manchester city 
harry kane wont live english football robert l to barca we dnt need him nunez does not seem capable enough for me' jst sayn🤷‍♂️ 
you cant mock anyone when harry kane is one of you're own 😂😂 
what's harry kane doing on this list 
they tried in sneaking harry kane 
when you have harry kane you dont score from penalties 
they robbed us points vs spurs that harry kane red card and their goal which wasn't a goal 
harry kane probably would 
sadly agree key to him being so good at spurs initially was eriksen in behind and then dele playing as a cf with kane up top 
how i wish harry kane will react to this comment 😂😂🤌 
you betrayed him he could have the most coveted for golden boot if you only gave him the penalty kicks you were wasting on harry kane 
aren't you supposed to provide a match report the telegraph managed full reports for other games today but nothing for the spurs match yet you found time to post an article about whether conte is going to stay or not presumably because harry kane is now settled 
well deserved i think you're better than harry kane people might laugh but the golden boot says enough for me 
no harry kane takes the penalties the team wins together before an individual accolade 
he doesn't know what trophies are he's just like harry kane 💀 
it's because it's harry kane 
utter dog shit and they have the bare cheek to talk about signing harry kane from us with and actually mean it 😍🤤🥴 
just a reminder harry kane and son haven't touched a trophy 
let's hope he doesn't say harry kane isn't part of the plan next season 🙄 
better than harry kane 
we have to admit conte is on different level to arteta quite sure conte wouldn't release harry kane in january without bringing a replacement 
like say na harry kane babe😂 
you've got more chance of seeing harry kane in a west ham shirt than the spuds being 8 10 points behind city next season 
top 4 you're having a laugh spurs would be lucky to finish in middle of the table we have harry kane throwing his toys out of the pram because he couldn't join city in the summer kane obviously didn't want to be here pt2 
jack grealish has touched a trophy more than harry kane 
harry kane made it in 14 seasons alan shearer made it in 14 seasons thierry henry made it in 9 seasons king salah made it in 5 seasons 👑 
harry kane na lie you be no want make e win am 😂😂😂😂 cos i no see why you no go give am those penalties before today match 😂😂 
harry kane take him away madrid take him away for good 
his one of you're own harry kane his one of you're own 😂😂 
harry kane should've got it last season you have to be called kevin to win 
i feel sorry for harry kane 
so is harry kane kulusevski bentancur and romero the foundations are there for a massive summer 
hahaha you do realise harry kane is one of your own dont you 😂😂 
it's still interesting to harry kane if nobody else 
blame harry kane for not allowing him to take the penalties 
harry kane season 2 
this could have been harry kane tottenham are so wrong for this 😭😂 
than harry kane 
well i can't say i'm not pleased to see the back of that season thank god it's over however tottenham were pleasing on the eye today son is a joy to watch and kane is well just harry kane a proper player mind you we would make vladimirputin look good at present😩 ncfc 
harry kane come to arsenal to touch trophies son you can go to inter milan to win trophies spurs is killing you guys 
usually when real life celebrities collab with fortnite they get to do something fun with their design but harry kane and marco reus are just themselves but in fortnite it's really boring in comparison 
moments that determined our fate 3 pts bergwijn game winning brace v leicester 3 pts sanchez game winning header v watford 1 pt son crucial goal v liverpool 3 pts harry kane game winner v city 3 pts regui go ahead goal in 70' v leeds 3pts son goahead goal v city thfc coys 
bro son really deserve it he scored all his goals without penalty he could have scored more but harry kane dae undermine am ⚽️❤️ 
why didn't harry kane or ronaldo win it by penalty kick 
por harry kane 
harry kane's instagram story completed it mate 
novice manager had lacazette upfront and world class manager had harry kane and son upfront yet world class manager got only 2 more points than the novice manager 
harry kane is the best no 9 on the planet you must be joking 
salad has only won golden boot once outright twice he's shared it so only been outright best strikers once terry henry and harry kane only won it outright never shared 
before harry kane 
best striker in the world behind harry kane 👑 
then why did people points at harry kane's world cup golden boot were all penalties and didn't deserve to win it 
under conte heung min son had 19 goals most in the league in that time period and 6 assists harry kane had 16 goals 2nd most in the league in that time period and 8 assists 4th most in the league during that time period 
when conte was appointed heung min son had 4 goals and 1 assist in 10 appearances harry kane had 1 goal and 1 assist in 9 appearances 
please tell harry kane at your old club how you've been celebrating🤣 
harry kane is a good player but he's overplayed he's very good but the media has been hyping him up too much it's a fact that he will never reach the real top level 
top 4 you're having a laugh spurs would be lucky to finish in middle of the table we have harry kane throwing his toys out of the pram because he couldn't join city in the summer kane obviously didn't want to be here 
wee need harry kane next season in manchester united 
golden boots in the premier league era 4 thierry henry 3 mohamed salah alan shearer harry kane 2 didier drogba jimmy floyd hasselbaink michael owen robin van persie 1 17 other players 
last time the anorexic chicken balancing on a basketball won a trophy george bush was the president ronaldhino was in his prime at barcelona the europa league was called the uefa cup and harry kane supported arsenal 😂😂😂 
if conte can get someone to accompany kane and son i think he will also be very competitive i've noticed that man city's biggest flaw is that they honestly can't deal with a striker with good hold up play it is why they tend to look vulnerable when playing against harry kane 
harry kane is overrated and has scored only 13 goals excluding penalties if he were not english no one would flatter him to the extent that he does not belong 
as harry kane steals it and runs off with and the media ignore saying kane probably deserved it 
should have been harry kane 🤔 
moments that determined our fate 3 pts beegwijn game winning brace v leicester 3 pts sanchez game winning header v watford 1 pt son crucial goal v liverpool 3 pts harry kane game winner v city 3 pts regui go ahead goal in 70' v leeds 3pts son goahead goal v city thfc coys 
to tell me the probabilty of lfc not losing our 2 premierleague matches when two dangerous leg breaking injuries from harry kane and west ham that should have resulted in red cards was high to the day i die i will never recognise city as champions in 19 or 22 
harry kane has a grand total of 0 career trophies 🥶 🥶 best striker to ever grace the prem 
yet he has more trophies than harry kane 
jack grealish to harry kane be like 
2 points 1 he is not vocal on the pitch this may change as he develops 2 harry kane isn't captain of spurs 🤣 
problem is we now need to improve the squad hopefully there is a few targets in klopps radar another attacking midfielder another 20 a year striker harry kane will do 
best englishman behind harry kane when he stays fit 
what part of it isn't true he's under contract until next summer so he will be here need to stop twisting what he says 34 mins into skys commentary of the city game and they started the harry kane shite again… gonna be a long summer 
what do you mean too introverted what kind of metric is that you are applying to filter for a successful captain in a football club have you met harry kane who has been a very good captain for tottenham

harry kane twin partner they are the best watch out for more goals next season 😂😂😂 
if i was you i'd more more concerned about sorting out your man boobs than worrying about harry kane 
han han 😂 anyways the only two footballers i care about it harry kane and messi i like messi and harry kane likes kohli 
remove the pen harry kane has only 13 goals and is a mediocre player with english nationality 
trophies harry kane has won prem ❌ fa cup ❌ carabao thing ❌ community shield ❌ and less trophies than matt smith🥶 🥶 
harry kane did that last year and got nothing for it 
harry kane would have celebrated with us but he's unlucky 
eddie nketiah has more trophies than 30 year old harry kane 
you missed his imaginary masterclass with ndombele and dele in midfield conte himself decried the state of the squad before the transfers and threw tantrums to emphasize that he also didn't have to deal with injuries to harry kane imagine where spurs would have ended 
imagine being harry kane😂😂😂😂😂 
harry kane is unworthy of his fame 
harry kane mate 👍 
salah has missed out in previous seasons to harry kane when salah didn't take pens and kane takes all of wm 
matt smith has more trophies than 28 year old harry kane let that sink in 
forget mbappe now go for son heung min and while you are at it get harry kane as well 
harry kane is a 🤡 compared to sonny 
darwin ou harry kane ♥️ 
if he stays fit he should go to the world cup best english striker behind harry kane 
who cares harry kane the better player did this last season 
this current pl you could probably on say harry kane will go down as a top 5 all time great no one else i wouldn't have thought maybe a salah but not sure depends if he sticks around 
walker moved from spurs to city 4 epl titles about 10 or more trophies in total mahrez from leicester to city 3 epl titles about 6 trophies in total ake 2 epl titles grealish came in just this season and he already has 1 epl title sorry for you harry kane 
grealish to harry kane amp harry maguire be like 
no way he has more trophies than harry kane at that age 
harry kane right now 
i wonder what harry kane thinking right now 🥲 jack grealish epl easy 😂 
so close but not close enough unlucky sonheungmin if only harry kane wasn't selfish and let him take at least one penalty 
this could have been harry kane 
if england are in it football joel will be very much present rocking the harry kane skin on fortnite as well of course 
harry kane no real 
trophies in the last 5 seasons arsenal football club 2 christian eriksen 1 harry kane 0 equals career high numbers heung min son 0 tottenham hotspur football club 0 😉 not with spurs 
your league is good thanks to foreign coaches and foreign players without them you will be nothing just look at the mediocre coach you have in your team you have a losing player like harry kane as captain without any important title 
more trophy than harry kane 
do some reading here i'd think that you as a professional cut those ties when you sign for a rival club so i doubt kulu and doherty would call themselves arsenal fans in the future 
harry kane's nightmare 😂😂😂😂😂 
this could have been harry kane 
and harry kane will played ucl football more than the whole arsenal players 😂😭 
yeah dw you boys done the job in the end😂 be fucked when harry kane fucks off to win trophies 
lmao olivier's career gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt x1000000000 gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt harry kane 
have to admit that's a nice trophy for tottenham and harry kane👍 
this coulda be you harry kane 
last season harry kane won both awards… did he win the pfa award 
harry kane at somewhere fighting for a ucl spot 
exactly i just pity harry kane and h m son nothing to show for their time in spurs shirt both have spent close to a decade there now and they still have the guy to make jest of youthful arsenal side that can boast of trophy in recent years 
i do believe we need a proper number 9 like harry kane in order to stop drawing games too many points dropped cuz our traditional attackers were stopped by team parking the bus 
most shocking was when harry kane was overlooked for the poty last year despite having the highest goals and assists 
congraturation harry kane 💙 
i know ronaldo messi myanmar or naimar idk his exact name chhetri maradona harry kane and i also know another ronaldo another player with named ronaldinho 
harry kane should see this 
so harry kane shouldn't have one no nor his world cup golden boot 
please harry kane next season we welcome you to come and play in manchester united with the new manager from ajax erick tenhag he want to sign you in united 
will darwin nunez join to be harry kane deputy 
only epl players i wana hear u tlkin too ▪︎ henng min son ▪︎ reece james ▪︎ harry kane

enjoy losing harry kane to a big club 
go harry kane coys 
merited deserved and accomplished welcome to champions league football that's where you belong arsenal and their fans should continue their quest in europa league harry kane the best no 9 in the world 
what the hell is wrong with pens 😂😂your harry kane when he take the prize score a lot of penalties 
just one question harry kane why didn't you let him to take penalty if he had scored just one penalty he might be the leading scorer not the joint scorer 
harry kane wasn't awarded the poty for doing the same last season 
it would be harry kane 😂 
just think harry kane could have been celebrating a premier medal today instead 
was harry kane named player of the season last season for doing the same people should stop this charade 
i just finished my a levels and asked harry kane if he was gonna be joining me at queen mary's university he then turned and told me sorry i'm going to ucl instead 
he is staying harry edward kane is staying at tottenham hotspur football club 
and harry kane hasn't it this life no balance 
harry kane still dey collect sugarcane 
hahaha son… lucky that's funny son scored 23 goals and became joint top scorer with salah without taking set piece and penalty if harry kane allowed son pk taker pity for salah 
harry kane did it first i'm not impressed 
harry kane is the best pen taker in world football why would he 
harry kane did it first it doesn't impress me 
hands off harry kane 
now has more epl trophy 🏆 than harry kane manchester city premierleague manchestercity mciavl 
another harry kane master class 
and we also love you harry kane for sticking with spurs you are an inspiration to us fans amp we love you for continuing to give us hope xxx 
ah yes because harry kane and son never played for spurs before conte joined 
why are you following harry kane you boob 
harry kane you are one of our own 🥳 
both have more trophies than harry kane and son 
harry kane tax 
you need harry kane bro you have to get him 
4 more than harry kane 😂😂 
juventus doesn't have to face harry kane twice a year at tottenham lmao also i'm sure either leao or vini could play on the right 
well same as harry kane who didn't wins it the year after for some reason de bruyne robbed both kane and salah 
harry kane said you not outside 
e do ah u people dey ment why harry kane win am u squad no go comot the penalties sia fior pains 😂😂 
harry kane 8 to me the best player in the premier league despite a very slow start and having one of the worst finishing season of his career this man has been a demon genuinely there's not one player like him and he's added a bit of clutchness too stay forever harry please 
harry kane did it last season😂 
think harry kane will move to chelsea this offseason also wondering if son will win the championship's version of the golden boot for tottenham in 2023 24 
except he's neither a lb nor a lwb and will not be consistent playing from there neymar on the left and kenedy on the right topped up with harry kane in the middle we'd be cooking defences all season long 
in addition to this heung min son 19 amp harry kane 16 are the top scoring players in the league since conte took over the whole team has improved but the big two have consistently delivered 
better than harry kane 
so basically harry kane 
shoooooot lol the champs added the wunderkind haaland liverpool might be in flex mode next season if they ko real for the big prize can y'all flirt with harry kane to keep some hope up lol 
harry kane must commit to tottenham next season the champions league is coming home to tottenham 
aw my least favorite player jk harry kane holds that title prominently 😁 
next season will show if he can truly be a big part or not unitil then harry kane deserves better and i hope he gets it 
here's hoping harry kane finds his way to chelsea 
because we have harry kane to take pens 
did arteta have harry kane and son shut your mouth bro 
although harry kane would have won his first premier league title today 
no that was harry kane last year with both 1 more assist as well and didn't have to share it 
harry kane 2020 2021 win the golden boot and the playmaker award salah 
lmao i'm sure pr athletic has written that arteta's arsenal aren't the youngest team to play in prem stop that propaganda line also other teams suffered injury lmaooooooo harry kane wasn't even scoring until like december next season excuse would be qatarworldcup2022 
harry kane 6 10 shit until december his usual self since then golden boot and pl pots loading for next season 
🤣🤣🤣🤣 cannot wait to see the small teams destroy tottenham in the ucl so embarrassing can't even reach conference finals however well done on another season with no trophies another season where harry kane and son will not be remembered in the future by any non spurs fan 
stopp if i opened hobis story to harry kane i would literally cry 
harry kane has played more minutes in goal 3 in european football than aaron ramsdale pipe the fuck down you squatter 
it's harry kane's fault 
absolute bollocks and you can add that stonewall pen amp non sending off of harry kane to that kavanagh amp tierney ref amp var for both incidents 
just listen to what he said about benzema after he battered chelsea a few weeks back i think now he's up there with harry kane 🤡 
very ignorant point one man shows are ronaldo at united with de gea in goal there is no way you think son could have done it without harry kane as 1 example 
i love you and harry kane forever 
but i await ian fiveankles thesis on whether harry kane can be considered a top top top top top top top top top top top top striker if when a spurs player wins the 'golden boot title' and it isn't him onmyheadson 
after giving out penalties to harry kane shame upon ur team 
my word i must have erased that from my memory that bloody harry kane 
harry kane set up for all them goals 🤐 
if salah won pfa poty harry kane was totally robbed 
like ings has the passing in his game but lacks that work rate i mean basically we need harry kane😆😆😆 
thank harry kane and his referees 
harry kane will wait till hes not looking and take it off him 
sonny had it on his own for about five glorious minutes today too… harry kane having assisted him for most of them deserves a pat on the back too 
son nketiah and harry kane did did a great job for me let's wait next season to start 
with harry kane as the focal point 
entirely deserved result and whispers i watched the spurs all or nothing and now have a soft spot for son as well as harry kane so enjoy it until next season obvs 😘 
because harry kane is the best pen taker in the world so why would he not take them 🤔 
at least he got one what has harry kane won apart from being above arsenal 
he won it last season also when harry kane was topping everything 
you were one harry kane injury away from capitulation sit down 
spurs and harry kane will still win fuck all 😂😂😂 will always be a shit football club with a empty trophy cabinet 
i can't stand harry kane at all i wish arsenal would have🥺 
i hate it why was son not taking penalties foolish harry kane 😂😂 
think we should take a moment to thank pep for choosing jack grealish unused sub today over harry mother fucking kane that's like choosing lena dunham over scarlett johansson 
despite the 4 2 win over leicester this last time last year that end of season felt a lot sadder the end of something decline a potential harry kane departure looming now we're going somewhere we've qualified for the champions league thfc coys ttid nortot pl ucl 
golden boot winner and harry kane…ok 
lewandoski and harry kane the whole point of telling haaland to wait was because benzema is still playing lights out a backup for benzema is what's needed 
buy out clause just in case 😂😂 look at harry kane 
i'm an avid harry kane viewer 
son heung min 23 goals top scorer in the league harry kane 17 goals saka 11 goals esr 10 goals the difference 
he graduated from the harry kane university 😂 
i went harry kane 
harry kane is claiming it 
love that harry kane😎 
i guess he is ok lol i am a tottingham fan harry kane and son are my boys 
i used to live in thurrock every pub was infested with hammers wanting an argument about harry kane's genius they are in my top 5 teams i loathe 
i think he should play with someone else if we get a versatile player like jesus both can play as you say we need a team not a starting 11 you say the last 3 4 years he was 18 19 back then…players improve at the same age i saw harry kane at leyton orient and he was poor 
stat race for the golden boot pl this season mohamed salah 22 heung min son 21 cristiano ronaldo 18 harry kane 16 race for the golden glove pl this season alisson 20 ederson 20 hugo lloris 15 edouard mendy 14 aaron ramsdale 12 
bro you watch harry kane goa against norwich 
classic harry kane 
didn't even think just wait on a harry kane hatty next half 
how has harry kane got less trophies than yaya sanogoal🤦‍♂️ 
i'm in the final of a h2h we both have the same points needs chelsea to concede and harry kane to score with son doing nothing 
madrid just put in a bid for harry kane 
harry kane comes back out onto the pitch he's carrying his norwich shirt he throws it to the ground and proceeds to piss on it nobody even minds the fans all join in carrow road slowly fills with piss still better than watching nodge play ncfc 
ronaldo has a lot of quality for scoring goals today more inside the box a killer for the goal but united need someone that is also able to press for longer periods that is able to play better holding the ball and fixing the rivals centerbacks a bit like harry kane 
nah i'm repping harry kane he's my captain today in fpl 
we get linked to harry kane and instantly go trophyless… 
no way harry kane ever passes up an opportunity to score a goal it's why he breathes 
harry kane doubles the lead for tottenham and three more fans are getting plinusa mugs 👇 myplmorning

wtf 🤣🤣🤣 tammy wouldn't even have a competition let alone harry kane 
didn't see this tweet last year with harry kane 
harry fucking kane 
🔷 kane fit for spurs harry kane has shrugged off his illness and been named in tottenham hotspur's strongest side available against norwich city the england captain was a potential doubt after he missed training and pulled out of media commitments on friday 
no harry kane is a bottler to me coming to gerrad now he won only 6 major trophies in his entire career including 3 tin pot league cups and he bottled 17 league titles in a row and won no international trophies trophies are the currency of success in a team sport fella 
if assisted by harry kane for epl fantasy reasons 
harry kane and son about to rip norwich apart 
harry kane of course apparently son can't function without him 
lol must be a harry kane fan ahhh 
i didn't wanted to disrespect their players but it's true viv won euros with netherlands was olympics top scorer what has their la reina achieved with spain should i call her spanish harry kane for spain nt 
so harry kane and trent are midfielders too 🤡 
sadio mane's six goals on the final day of the premier league is a record only bettered by tottenham's harry kane 
harry kane starting thoughts g 
dutch harry kane she won trophies with netherlands also so much disrespect to kane 
maybe in another reality in the multiverse but on our earth 1218 that isn't happening with the form heung min son and harry kane are in 
he is great regardless will you not consider harry kane top striker even if he fails to win any trophy 🏆 in his career will you not consider messi and ronaldo great if they both in a wc gerrard has won everything other than league while playing for underdogs all the time 
not been impressed with either player then again harry kane was awful here too and he's not done too badly for himself 
why is harry kane in this graphic 
leicester city striker jamie vardy has scored six goals on the final day of the premier league only harry kane 8 has netted more among players currently playing in the competition statattack how many goals will vardy score today 🤔 it's the finalday action goalpoll 
❗️the names real madrid have been linked with so far • richarlison salah amp mane • mahrez • harry kane lewandowski darwin nuñez nkunku and leao 
final time tottenham hotspur have bottled the top 4 race harry kane own goal son own goal kulu own goal 
harry kane's ankle 
harry kane to score john mcginn to be booked 
if it was harry kane he wouldn't have been booked never mind sent off i'm amazed we appealed really we already knew the outcome 
yes but norwich vs tottenham live confirmed team news as harry kane starts dejan kulusevski returns 
gonna rep harry kane if we finish top 4 👍 and you rep son xd 
oh no get well soon you caught it off of harry kane 
rep harry kane if we finish top 4👍 
son has had his best season at tottenham since he joined in 2015 also claiming seven assists and is on course to break harry kane's run of ending as tottenham top scorer for seven straight seasons 
you guys should talk to harry kane to step back if penalty comes what the f is wrong with him he is very greedy 
the same thing happened to harry kane last season 
thfc make just one change from their win at home to burnley dejan kulusevski comes in at right wing for lucas moura harry kane does start despite previous rumours about illness nortot premierleague 
harry kane penalty

dutch harry kane she won the euros and league in two different countries 
saka has more trophies than harry kane son combined in england facts 
don't disrespect her like that harry kane never won any domestic titles amp for his country lmao 
so much insecurity because they know their club doesn't and will never care enough to build a team around their goat and she'll just end up leaving 🥴 my dutch harry kane theory just keeps proving itself 
if osimheh started his career in england and as an english boy harry kane would have had a good competition not saying others aren't doing well but not on his level 
has to be kane trust sonny to score but in that dictation it must be harry as the team must come first 
harry kane hatrick on the way 
waiting for a harry kane hatrick 
happend to harry kane as well kdb is just favored 
real madrid had a risky plan by signing just mbappe rudiger garcia i can tell you rm needs a deep reconstruction especially in the midfield k c m cannot make it every year rm needs new ideas i will go for silva tchoumeni harry kane 
harry kane to score and firpo to be carded 
all this transfer shite about harry kane one of england's most overrated strikers 
just like harry kane last season 🙂 oil money doings 
harry kane did the same last season 
one last dance this season triple captain harry kane 💪🏽 fpl fplcommunity 
pots player of the season son heung min tottenham hotspur what a player instrumental throughout the whole season and stepped up when their top player harry kane was out of form add 20 non pg 1 goal shy of the golden boot 
well it's obvious salah is arab muslim guy harry kane was top scorer and assits with more penalties last year and he won it and won every individual trophy so that's why nothing strange here 
man just chose harry kane out of all players💀 
are you captaining kane thanks legend 
kane and luis diaz for me already have mount couldn't risk keeping salah or richarlison good luck lads 
why do we need harry kane 
who the hell wants harry kane because madrid i very much doubt that i want it 
harry kane reads this tweet and quietly ponders his career you know… this costa diego bloke really wants me to join chelsea i mean he even used the word pliz i know my brother agent handcuffed me to spurs through 2024… but costa makes a very convincing argument done 🙄 
pickyourpunt odds on combined bet of harry kane to score a header and outside the area vs norwich please 
where was this same energy when harry kane did it last season 
harry kane son mo one of them 
harry kane has autism 
kane eo is lower than son we saw he won't share penalties so that gives harry a little advantage over son norwich is the team that have conceded the most penalties this season if you own both kane ©️ 
let me laugh like harry kane 😂😂😂 
last time out the hosts took the lead twice through mario vrancic and a serge aurier own goal but christian eriksen's free kick and harry kane's penalty saw us pick up a point under jose mourinho nortot thfc spursarmy 🎨 on ig 3 5 
mo salah was robbed proper just as harry kane was robbed last season de bruyne doesn't deserve the player of the season award 
that was harry kane last year should he have won it then son may yet win the golden boot but wasn't even nominated 
harry kane 1 shots on target amp son heung min 2 shots on target 
to be fair harry kane had better numbers last year and didn't win it i still think salah should have got it for his goals against city and watford on top 
i'm not even bantering when i say this if they want to win something they'll leave harry kane slots into nearly every team in the world same as son if they were serious about their careers they'd leave 
i will take harry kane all day let go for kane 😍 
not impossible considering it's already relegated norwich harry kane scores a lot in last game 
harry kane is the best striker 
scenes when harry kane bags a hat trick today 😅 
non existent running and physicality what's with the extremes 😂 your own stat source says ronaldo makes on average 6 pressures a game and only one less tackle every 5 games than harry kane 
how long do you think peaks last he's not cristiano we're looking at another harry kane 
harry kane from an arsenal fan 
kane eo is lower than son we saw he won't share penalties so that gives harry a little advantage over son norwich is the team that have conceded the most penalties this season kane 🧢 
they should go for harry kane 
harry kane's premier league hat tricks by season 2014 15 🎩 2015 16 🎩 2016 17 🎩🎩🎩🎩 2017 18 🎩🎩 2018 19 2019 20 2020 21 2021 22 
who listens to anyone who has no history or experience of the subject they are trying to tell us about it's like asking a primary schoolkid to take harry kane's place in the england side what ignoramus thought of this waste of time amp money 
if anything that shows how good harry kane is getting top goals and most assists in a team that didnt even finish top 6 last season 
same happened to harry kane last season its not a big deal 🤔 😕 he 
spurs 1 0 harry kane 
harry kane did poo himself 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 
it's a bit of a shame that it's come to this i keep thinking about that harry kane non red card and that rodri handball for which everton later got an official apology each of those was worth two points both together were worth four points so the race could've been over 
i swear harry kane isn't playing because his sick 
my god putting harry the loser kane in this list is like putting herpes on a list of things u want on holidays shutthebbcnow 
yourodds harry kane to assist son and son to assist harry kane v norwich 
ou harry kane 
yes in my opinion if chelsea got a good winger who's good at 1v1 situation and a strike who can use ball like harry kane i believe the energy of mount and his relentless runs will help chelsea attacking system or better still get a more creative midfielder beside him 
🔸firpo and zhaka to be carded ⚽️ son to score 2 goals 🤝harry kane to assist a goal 
god no not harry kane 
harry kane can do everything 
please what is harry kane no lewandowski the youngsters are welcome 
i would take harry kane any day any time 
wee harry kane 
please sign whoever you want but not harry kane 
harry kane 🙌 nothing to lose bro 😅 
same thing happened to harry kane last season didn't it 
rangnick is right look at harry kane he presses he creates if you call out awb for not being a complete rb then call out ronaldo too 
harry kane better to sign cr7 back 
he can finish maybe not every single time but that's the same for every player harry kane has taken 126 shots and has 16 goals ronaldo 110 and 18 goals 
grealish shouldn't worth more than £20m the only outstanding english player is harry kane 
harry kane didn't win it last year with most goal and assists 
same happened for harry kane last season and y'all kept quiet 
please god no not harry kane jesus christ 
salah is still haunted by his own previous success imagine just imagine harry kane with those stats there would be no debate 
ahhhh… harry kane last season… 🙄😑 
brownhill and cork carded son 2 plus goals and harry kane assist 
firpo amp doucoure to be carded harry kane to score two or more goals mo salah to assist a goal 
harry kane was both played well all season with most goals assists and didn't win it last season 
harry kane assisting twice for saka goal 
yes harry kane 
harry kane as a backup of karim i don't know man may not approve that 
where was this same energy when harry kane banged both goals and assists salah is a tap in merchant 
firpo amp brownhill to be cared harry kane to score 2 son to assist 
son score 2 harry kane assist and moutinho and brownhill book 
thiago and brown hill carded son 2 plus goals harry kane assist 
chasing a top 100k finish who's the best captaincy shout ©️ 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 harry kane 🇧🇪 kevin de bruyne or play it simple with 🇰🇷 son heung min 
firpo and weghorst to be carded cr7 to score two or more harry kane to assist a goal 
harry kane did the same last year the arguments needs to be more than that 
you must have hated fl too then he took long shots for fun anyone who scores goals takes loads of shots harry kane being prime example always nearing the top for shots taken in the pl 
harry kane topped goals and assists yet he didn't have any recognition last season for poty 
bro you know say definitely harry kane go score 
but not harry kane 20 21 though 🫣🙄 
and we've played the entire season without a striker and while that is the club's fault you can even blame arteta if you want but it doesn't change the fact we've had an incomplete team and all conte has done is make harry kane want to play for spurs again 
harry kane is tottenham's primary goal scorer but when he slacked sonny boy was there to pick up the pieces man son was the best player in the premier league considering tots midfield and all 
harry kane did it last season and wasn't named player of the season 
no one was talking about harry kane last season just because it didn't involve your club 
same thing happened to harry kane last year 🤷🏼‍♂️ 
so what see last season spare us your manufactured outrage better to ask how it's possible that the likely golden boot winner heung min son wasn't even a finalist for the player of the season award nor was harry kane far more ridiculous than whinging for mo salah 
so the same as harry kane last year mate 
you where harry kane 
even harry kane wasn't the player of the season when he led in goals and assists last season idk why ya'll are so pressed about this 
harry kane last season tops in goals and assist but didn't win it 
for today's front three i would choose harry kane dele alli and raheem sterling 
• harry kane to score baba never fail to score on the last day of the season • brighton v west ham draw 
harry kane is available 
i really like harry kane but that's outright replacement and likely upgrade to but you can't bench him at all you have to always rotate btw them till benzema leaves same as lewandowski 
harry kane was the same last season and didn't win it 
i can't be arsed to find other stats but i can assure no sane person specifically tweets stats only when harry kane is in them 
kane hauls over son today 
harry kane found how binding a verbal agreement can be last season best to suck it up 
same as harry kane last season… 
yes i remember he called tammy abraham a championship level player till the ucl final and after 90 minutes he was better than harry kane even he though he didn't play a single minutes ko games😭😭 
dembele to madrid joder that would be luis figo level dramatic he's not a star though madrid need a big name harry kane salah 
harry kane did the same last season and he wasn't named too so it's no big deal 🤷‍♂️ 
id take harry kane free transfer next year 
harry kane that's a odd way to say cristiano ronaldo busy be spanish phonetics 🤷🏼‍♂️ 
is kane or mane better when chasing rank 
napoli will lose chelsea will lose tottenham will win 7 goals harry kane 3 sevilla draw west ham draw 
harry kane has the most goals and assists last season and he wasn't the player of the season it's not always about goals assists the only player that was robbed and deserves the player of the season 2021 2022 is bernardo silva 💯🤷🏾‍♂️ 
not harry kane please 😭😭🤣🙏 
how do you explain the harry kane situation then 
wages of harry kane hype of mbappe treatment of ronaldo work rate of john carew stats of christain benteke decision making of overran good in training merchant if he wants to fight for a spot he can hog the bench till he proves himself otherwise he can f off to everton 
harry kane can be transformative but the guy is a bottler maybe champions around him can improve him 
i begggggg i want harry kane for once pleaseeeeeeee 
yes someone goes out there way to specifically find a stat that harry kane features in😂 
oh yes get me harry kane 
harry kane and lewandowski we want to play 3 strikers upfront or what 
harry kane didn't win it bruh shun the racist comment 
did harry kane win player of the season with this stat no baseless 
did you say harry kane did you say lewa bro delete this 
harry kane my hero 
harry kane darwin nunez lewandowski rafael leao what a lod of shite this manu guy 
harry kane is one of the greatest striker of his generation with lewan suarez benzema 
bring harry kane at bernabeu on my knees 
who invited my man harry kane 😹 
yeah harry kane if a perfect no 9 
harry kane please 
last harry kane led both yet the award went to ruben dias it's not about salah but favouritism towards city players yet guardiola has a defensive mechanism that everyone supports liverpool maybe he fears he might lose the title today a proud united fan only being objective 
not harry kane😭😭 
what is harry kane doing there 
harry kane or leao would be insane 
harry kane is how 
who tf invited harry kane 
son is better than harry kane 
left for me harry kane would make a significant impact 
kane scored the highest goals last season but was not voted as pots so what's it all about goals all these don't matter coz it's harry 
or champions league don't write it off yet harry kane and son are still feeling the remnants of the stomach bug spurs can be spursy 
you mean like harry kane last season only shocking thing about this season is that it was a liverpool player that was passed over unheard of 
the one person who did a stupid deal was harry kane footballers are starting to wake up now and are not begging a club for a deal they are setting the tone now 
awful biased pundit stand in agent for harry kane used his testimonial money to build a business instead of giving it to charity also most hypocritical man on the planet 
given us skippy and that scintillating forward for us harry kane what a player 
nah but if history is anything to go by harry kane will stat pad his way to golden boot on the last day again🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥 
declan rice harry kane and eden hazard 
option 4 mount and kane 
what about harry kane last season 😂😂😂 
harry kane last season had 23 goals 14 assists did not win it what is your point 
did harry kane win it last season 
harry kane's only solution now is to join bayern munich he can't go united city madrid paris or barca 
yes we never give up as liverpool and will never i wish next season klopp get one between harry kane or son 
over and above ruben dias…of course harry kane deserved it las season he was the reason they made top 4 
harry kane last season 
even whilst under performing salah still has 10 goal contributions in the same period of time as the rest son 13 kdb 17 salah 10… last season harry kane has most assists and goals scored and everyone cried he was robbed for not winning it… peoples agendas are mental 
how you can even say son was robbed is crazy 13 of his 21 goals came in the last section of the season mostly produced by harry kane and mostly tap ins kdb has 10 goals and 7 assists since march late feb this is player of the season not player of the quarter 
harry kane had the most assist and goals last season did you cry when he didn't win 
have you forgotten how your main man harry kane didnt want to play for ur team at start of the season 🤣🤣🤣🤣 my man went on strike 
that would be an amazing signing yes coming to the end of his career he likes dropping into midfield like harry son kane up top with lewandowski just behind awesome 
they should get harry kane in to replace 
mind games he won't captain kane either 
man city win amp over 2 5 harry kane to score liverpool over 1 5 chelsea over 0 5ht arsenal vs everton over 1 5 amxm of new castle over 1 5 shots good luck 🍀 
the great man and norwich flop loan harry kane 
harry kane last year had most goals snd assists but didnt win pots 
harry kane last year had most goals and assists but didnt win pots why should mo salah win it while kane didnt win last year 
last season harry kane had the most goals and most assists in the league ruben dias won player of the year 
forget what they have won we are talking about epl player of the season which should be easily rated by individual performance in a season and harry kane do it all last season but they give it to debruyne because they won the league epl is so bias 
worst scoring season of his career and with a game to go harry kane has scored 37 
ask harry kane 
from the start of the season is harry kane at training 😡 to the end of the season is harry kane at training 🙏 
my only hope is that when they inevitably do win they're found to have fielded an ineligible player they're deducted three points harry kane drives home in a drunken rage gets stopped and done for three years son moves to juve conte's hair gains sentience and attacks him 
your ryan reynolds is a better harry kane than your actual harry kane it's still not a great harry kane of course but a better one 
same happened to harry kane last season 
when we consider on your perspective we can also judge last season harry kane was top assist and top scorer and was not selected salah was good but after second leg his performance has decreased and has also not scored goals during second leg talking of his persistence 
so was harry kane last season 
doesn't make you the best player in the league 🤡 harry kane did it last season 
city was pursued harry kane all summer long until ronaldo was offered by his agent if city really convinced with the deal why don't they just pay £12m which is nothing to juventus not to mention that they only want to pay ronaldo £250k compare to £500k at united 👇 👇 👇 
harry kane why not 
harry kane has no ambition 
you cant denie that harry kane is an amazing striker bet you guys wished you had him for the past 6 years 
we disappointed but it is not end for us player not above club think about harry kane last season there also disagreement still city won league so for us we move on from them let's check past how many rejected city but still don't disrespect anyone 
stop with the race card man harry kane did the same thing last year still didn't win 
option four is best salah to mount richarlison to kane with 4 
harry kane last season 
5 0 harry kane' hatrick and son's brace 
4 harry kane did the same as salah but salah did it in a top two team in the world and kane did it in a shit tottenham 
the same happened to harry kane last season 🥱 
harry kane finished top goal scorer and top assists 20 21 and didn't win it ether in fact he had more goals and assist than salah has this season 
i'm not running with it though simply not buying that he gave them his word and verbal agreements mean nothing at all in football everybody does verbal agreements terms agreed is nothing i said this when the same thing came up in the harry kane thing contracts or nothing 
it's harry kane 
hazard and harry kane both won it at that age 
same thing happened to harry kane with highest g a 
so harry kane 
i'm captaining harry kane cuz we don't deserve cl football after bottling a 4 point lead 
harry kane takes it none this sentimental bollox saying that if son has scored and were 3 up maybe he'd allow him take it i suppose 
haaha of course the ref will try everything to see harry kane top the game 
they did the same to harry kane last season 
harry kane clear 
last season harry kane topped both the goals and assists log and he wasn't awarded the poty but it wasn't robbery then abi 
harry kane had the most goals and assists last season and didn't win it 
oh plz it's starting to make sense wat pep said about people supporting liverpool harry kane had most goals and asssist last year but didn't get awarded the player of the season and he was consistent through out the season didn't stop halfway like salah 
i mean ask harry kane same happened last season 😂 
when harry kane didn't win it last season i knew the award is a shit award 
very dissapointing harry kane deserves it last season and gbam kdb 
if it was harry kane they will obviously name him the player of the season biase set of people 
could harry kane win the goals scored on the final day of a season trophy 
also under your narrative marcelo flores is probably getting a juicy sponsorship in dollars for choosing mexico instead of waiting for england i mean he could've been playing next to harry kane and grealish but instead came for that money mexico gets from those usa tours 
quote harry kane has bagged a hat trick of end of season 20 21 awards with the striker named our one hotspur members' player of the season junior members' player of the season and our official supporters' clubs' player of the season from the tottenham website 
the difference is that harry kane won nothing but salah's contribution is reaping results at all fronts 
as unlucky as harry kane was last year with most assists and goals 
harry kane a striker top goals and assists last season and never won it let's talk about that 👍🏼 
i would take harry kane and say those famous words drink it in this is what you could of won harry 😁 
harry kane was also denied that award on kdb's expense last season this award only a popularity contest and it favors players in the big clubs 
i have kane richarlison and nketiah is it worth taking a 4 hit to bring in toney for richie or just roll with harry and eddie thanks 
harry kane last year golden boot and top assists white european and he still didn't win poty 
did harry kane win player of the season last season just asking 
a better finisher an easier opponent while wolves might be in bottom 3 for xg and xgc they are still wolves can park the bus anytime norwich however can't do that 😅 have a bit of harry kane bias 🤓 
all this race stuff should just stop abeg harry kane last season is a prime example that goals and assist are not the only basis for the award and he is an english man their best striker sef 
son and salah both tied harry kane theabsaassist absagoalrush 
if harry kane had those numbers kdb wouldn't be winning that voting pattern regardless 
apparently jermaine jenas still tried to vote for harry kane as the young player of the year 
harry kane to madrid transfer saga begins now 
harry kane also did dis and wasn't named player of the season 
as a fan what prohibited me to expect from him i don't want him to go down with huge talents say like harry kane 
main character harry kane 
harry kane topped both last season and was ignored for the award 
250m is so little in an era where lukaku is worth 110m osimeh 110m and 120m was not enough to get harry kane by the way mpappe just got a 300 m signing on fee 
they should go for harry kane and son 
they did the same to harry kane last year giving it to ruben dias 
i think salah and richarlison for mount and kane is the best option for your team what transfers would you suggest i'm getting son c but for salah or mahrez 4 waiting on team news do you think salah starts trent amp mahrez to matip amp son 4 worth a hit to keep salah 
sign harry kane 
just like harry kane last season gotta question these voters 
penalties scored 3 harry kane 45 8' spurs v burnley richarlison 45 2' everton v brentford ashley barnes 45' burnley v aston villa 
harry kane for continuing to prove also wrong and prove you can never bet against him 
i like option 4 mount and kane captain kane 
ts funny cause both weren't even able to qualify for ucl finals man city would be exciting to watch tho somebody please get a contract for harry kane pleaseee 
not harry kane 
i want sonny to win golden boot but team comes 1st and harry kane is the man when it comes to penalties coys 
clear as day salah robbed 22 goals 15 odd assists 😂 if this was harry kane he'd have won it eyes closed 
harry kane will fit properly in our current squad 
wait until you hear about harry kane 
harry kane is carrying spurs every season and has nothing to show for it in the most competitive league in the world he could also have moved to madrid or bayern and have 100 trophies by now what is a wasted career anyway when you are making millions 
he not the first to do sooo harry kane did it all soo idgaf 
fair enough de bruyne is a fantastic player but yet harry kane last season gets most goal assists amp wins f k all these awards are a joke as for the balloon d'or not even kev will ever win this unless he plays for a spanish team 
spurs 10 harry kane 
so did harry kane last season what's your point exactly 
james del chelse harry kane del thotenham marcus racford del manchester 
harry kane or declan rice 
if he indeed deserve it then it means harry kane was cheated last year because what ever salah did this season kane has also done it last season 
harry kane says hold my beer… 
now giving everything to city last time harry kane was rubbed this time mo salah son are rubbed this league used to be good now its worst than ligue 1 
harry kane 😂 he does not want to go to spain he wants to stay in england he wants to beat top premier league goals plus he has family here and he is not gonna learn spanish leave him alone 
the 0 1 loss was in 2014 when the team didn't have harry kane or heung min son it was when adebayor was leading the line if you are going to post these stats post the arsenal record vs everton as well it's lllwdl and it's more recent 
easy harry kane 
harry kane didn't win it last season with the same stats so don't play the race card here 
option 4 mount kane 
it happens bro chill kk you never complain for harry kane why sallah check stats with kdb and sallah which has made impact to their team… mané did better for lipool than sallah no to talk of kdb 
the burden of an attacker to produce numbers and perform well gt gt gt gt harry kane messi etc i would rather have james as captain cool as a cucumber and ability wise the best we have got it helps mount to concentrate on football also 
harry kane did same he wasn't named player of the season either 
kane got 3 golden boots more assists in the epl than cristiano can ever dream of and offers more to any time than ronaldo can atm playing a position in football isn't a one dimensional you're part of an 11 man squad and harry kane offers more than cr7 atm 
ask harry kane how that feels 
you're just pulling me somehow being a ben fan out of thin air lol i wanted him gone for harden last year like i said earlier in this thread lol ben simmons is the nba version of harry kane 
didn't i slap you about with tottenham… i remember kane putting a hatrick on your head

three goals involved in all of them ✅ 
definitely not biased but thor ulfarsson and sebastian ferreira should be in this list
