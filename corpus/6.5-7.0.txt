anthony taylor has no hesitation to blow for a foul it's because he believed in pickford's ability to clear more than the palace opposition's attacking threat respect will be secured when earned 
half of the squad should have been dropped into bramley moore dock before they started filling it in but jordan pickford anthony gordon richarlison and especially the fans deserve huge credit for dragging us through these last few weeks 💙💙

i mean i give zero fucks about ingerlund winning anything but still seems obvious they've got more chance with an actual goalie in nets rather than calamity jordan 
greatest timing om a tweet ever hahah jordan pickford you clown

second time this has happened to anthony gordon specifically btw worst referees in the world and i don't even think it's close 
playing this anthony gordon yte over demari is gross negligence tbh 
i don't remember the first goal but after that ayew scissored down anthony gordon and just got yellow two minutes later he scored a scrappy goal with his chin 
i believe the rule anthony taylor followed in not sending off ayew was fuck anthony gordon that kid deserves it

he came on he felt the reception at half time he got whilst going through his warm up and he took that game by the scruff of the neck the goal scorers will get the credit but dele alli won everton that game

nah dele alli is ass cheeks dude ke lebala go go bolella congratulations on your grad 🥳 
you guys critize others as though you know what a drop in form means if a player drops in form does it mean he's done thank bro 
gonna need the dele alli that turned up the 2nd half tonight to turn up again on sunday 🤨👌🏿🤨 starboy evecry

going by rumours frankie's looking to get rid already in summer wat a class manager if you think yous got away with ffp good luck frankie likes to blow money lol 
dele alli was superb tonight completely changed the game it should of happened before this game but i'm hoping that's the spark to light the fire delealli everton 
one of these managers signed coutinho digne and olsen the other signed flops like dele alli and vdb on loan and an unknown mykolenko we will continue this discussion next season https t co xlubniog5y 
i could only see allan as a possible option at half time lampard got just enough out of dele alli just when it mattered most frank lampard's managerial credentials are going up and up evecry efc 
all these dele alli hate i didn't forget it 
i cannot wait to see whats in storr next season thats the dele fucking alli i know 
great goals from keane richarlison and dominic calvert lewin ⚽️ dele alli changed the game for me 👏👏 it's not just a game it's our life 🔵 🔵 evecry 🦅 efc coyb everton utft goodison 💙 
dele alli is the most useless player 
i'm not even accepting that everton's squad is a mess the man asked to have dele alli and van der beek buy some defenders and creative midfielder maybe 
dele alli may not seem the best player for a crisis but his passing's been quicker less predictable more accurate palace somewhat less assured 
everton sub at ht dele alli replaces andre gomes 
pickford azpilicueta maguire ben white walker foden jorginho fernandes bernardo silva richarlison kane subs ramsdale mount james maddison dele alli vardy 
i think he’d scored his first hat trick at 17 for dons 26 now and fucked 
dele alli alli had fallen out of favour in north london with a number of managers having overlooked the 26 year old who has fallen from a status as one of the pl's most exciting young talents to a forgotten figure in the division he hasn't impressed at everton either https t co zikvuj2yp5 
and now we dont know where he play for 😅 
i'm travelling during the game tonight maybe a blessing in disguise 
don't worry you go blow i can feel it 
dele alli is shaking the world of football 
he is not world class think of the players who are world class and then compare dele alli 😂 
have you forgotten all the stuff the media and pundits said about jose cos of dele alli

55' why does will hughes look like some sitcom comedian that probably toured with jeff foxworthy back in the '90s 
shouldnt have taken will hughes off tbh massively underrated player thanks tho see you in the prem next season https t co fbm0fskk3y 
but that's the worst that will happen these dumb republicans think it's just a simple matter of throwing out legally cast votes and the country will simply go along with it 
that's why we have rules 
i have no idea how we turned that around think will hughes going off was the catalyst myself 
seems to me there are an awful lot of pwme who having had rare cases of spontaneous recovery use whatever protocols they were on when they recovered as sales pitches to the still suffering it worked for me so it will work for you with tempting promises of satisfaction 
mike will shadow our beloved lyn hughes in the day to day running of the club whilst taking on our potential sunday teams secretary role if we decide to introduce one we’d like to thank mike for his continued work for the club and wish him well in this new role 2 2 
getting dominated by will hughes at home jfc championship might be the best thing for fat frank 
32' eve 0 1 cry will hughes booked for a terrible tackle on gordon 
often founders don't know either so they do what they think the vc will like best rip insurtech 1 0 
but this is not a foregone conclusion 
but in my view if you're great at drafting amp you're finishing in the bottom 10 of the league you can find talent 
accepting that john hughes will not be in charge of dafc next season https t co ldm0jxfnxr 
watch he’ll abandon his twitter bid he’ll buy up a bunch of tesla stock as a “show of how much he believes in his company” amp then the stock will rebound …and he’ll have made tons of 🧀🧀🧀 
we also will be forced to listen some biased experts but cuz her team doesn't have much time left it will be much shorter that it was with dr hughes 
43 of their combined fights have went to decision there is a small sample size but activity plus possible time in clinch makes me believe this will go the distance elise reed is 3 0 in decisions whereas sam hughes is 2 2 
the club wants financial flexibility to bring in their own guys at will over time puljujarvi isn't the type of player i would see hughes coveting at this time

hmmmm why will governments acquire a land 4 national use n refuse to pay wat is due to de families amp turn around amp be selling de acquired langstone benefit governments people 
well the 49'ers money will be a boon to our championship campaign i guess 
everything under nana addo is either being sold or collateralize agyapa is in the pipeline now achimota is next which type of leaders do we have in this country johniesbite 
my motivation is fear i found it in sheep by ted hughes “…it was not that he could not thrive he was born with everything but the will – that can be deformed just like a limb death was more interesting to him life could not get his attention so he died…” 
sen hughes says initiative signatures should be more about quality than quantity she says paying gatherers by the hour rather than by the signature will make them more engaged on the issue 
what 2 things do all these players have in common based on your 2 biggest content weapons mcilroy cam smith speith will zal woods si woo munoz kuchar hughes matt jones and glover 
the cavs thought larry hughes was a suitable substitute for getting michael redd the browns thought coming back in 1999 was a good idea the diamondbacks thought shelby miller was worth trading dansby swanson for and then some

in conclusion ben white varane 
at the end of all of this i’m very disappointed with manu fans who are following up this agenda imo ben white did better than varane but both lt lt 
what ben is describing is an attempt to create new voters because to the dnc immigrants are just a means to an end 
an i cannot believe varane made ben white last this long i can’t even say who had the better season one was bought to win the league that team moved from 2nd to potential conference league the other was purchased to just improve the squad and help the team to be a genuine top 4 
to history seems how you keep repeating it every time the democratic party gets into office they play black and white against each other that’s how ignorant this shit is and then we get people like ben crimp or whatever his attorney ass name is and all he does is come out and 
then there was the worst decision of them all ben white and saliba 50m spent on white who is actually a really good player with the ball but has zero concept of defending he just can’t sense danger

three changes for afc ben white returns from injury and there are starts too for nuno tavares and emile smith rowe in place of the suspended rob holding cedric soares and gabriel martinelli 
gabi x ben white too literally no excuses not to win 
two changes all told as fabian schar and callum wilson come in gabriel and ben white fit to start but wilson will certainly test them kieran trippier on the bench alongside a number of long serving players could be an emotional night for some as their final night at st james' 
how's that specific enough 
sanchez thiago silva virgil ben white kdb ndidi kalvin phillips coutinho bowen ronaldo son jose sa ben mee trippier cathcart gilmour olise ward prowse richarlison ivan toney 
humanity can not really handle over population thanos was right 
it’s newsworthy because racism still exists and this guy was radicalized by white supremacists online unfortunately some people go from “innocent” outlets like ben shapiro but just keep going more extreme after that 
trump famously blew it up by asking why people were coming from shithole countries in africa instead of places like finland meanwhile mfs like ben say it's not about white supremacy it's about cultural assimilation while simultaneously arguing america's culture is white 
do not let ben's rhetorical jumble in pursuit of self absolution distract you from two realities 1 ben fuels white fear and white rage and 2 ben could not work a single starbucks shift 
the neo cons like ben inevitably fail to create a compelling enough story to deal with this stuff and that leaves the door wide open 
palestine is a different civilization to israel for conservatives like ben the west vs the east most israelis are not white 
no gabriel and potentially no ben white means nufc will be licking their lips especially with callum wilson back fit could we see xhaka at cb with tomiyasu although do still feel ben white will be included in the squad team news in just over an hour 👀⏳ 
2 if you genuinely think gabriel covers for ben white more than the other way around i have nothing to say to you 3 using goals as any kind of measuring stick for a defenders’ ability is so so dumb sure goals are nice defensive prominence is much better 
i would fucking fight ben shapiro at the drop of a hat but ultimately i would rather he just fucking grasp that white supremacists will be thrilled to let him carry their water but they will eventually remember that he's jewish 
it's pretty clear what side are echoing the great replacement theory ben great replacement theory white supremacy and anti immigration rhetoric go hand in hand 
ben pay no attention to the man behind the curtain get real end fox 
obama spent years talking about healing the divide in america his 2004 speech about it is what him on the map carlson spews nightly screeds about immigrants white replacement and so many other dangerous far right tropes 
attorney ben crump “not one more human being should be taken from this earth because of white supremacy … something has to be done ” 
elite striker progressive cm pacey creative winger and we're golden

ben shapiro and other mainstream conservatives don't see that they're playing footsies with white nationalists by echoing the same grievances only with a slightly different coat of paint 
i benched nketiah and ben white so i might cry tonight 😭

leeds utd should be grateful show us some ♥️ 
is ben shapiro a white supremacist does ben shapiro’s sit on a butt plug while tweeting does ben shapiro pleasure himself to news of gun violence anyone can ask anything and it doesn’t mean anything because it’s a question lolololol 
do want to venmo me for your english lessons what book s did you read last anything by an author that isn't a white man 
the diz kronenberg award was give at the freshman level this award was given to a freshman player that demonstrated enthusiasm and passion in improving themselves and their teammates freshman white winner ben fesenmeier freshman purple winner jack wright 
saint maximin bruno almiron callum wilson running at them trippier crossing etc 
the majority of hate comes from the republican party we have a republican problem in america 
ramsdale 7 10 he's talied off recently tomy 9 10 wish he didn't get injured ben white 7 5 10 good start nuno 4 10 but arteta helped his downfall sambi 5 10 flattered to deceive mo 8 10 pretty much good but need more goals 
do you disagree with that ben 
clever use of the loan market will also help it's an area orta has failed in every season with the notable exception of ben white find the next white and lufc will be further strengthened 
bernie sanders didn’t broadcast hate racist bigoted and violent ideology daily obama didn’t either tucker carlson and ben shapiro are absolutely guilty of broadcasting hate bigoted racist and violent ideology rooted in white supremacy every day 2 whitesupremacy gop 
amp yeah tomi put in a shift at cb vs spurs warra playa🔥 
apparently he’s unaware what the night of long knives was 
no condemnation of white supremacy replacement theory or racism she might as well have said “stand back and stand by “

dude you need help 
worked out pretty well i think 
of course she's not a white supremacist but 100 she's playing the same cynical game for base votes and support that you and the rest of your morally bankrupt political right embraces and amplifies 
if you talk about the great replacement how bad white people are and how much better it is with diversity it's a good thing if you say 'no white people are ok and allowing millions of third worlders in isn't a good idea' you are racist 
the 4 most powerful cabinet members are jews while our borders are being overrun where has the anti white talk for 20 years ben coming from ben knowitall 
we signed ben white and conceded more goals imagine if arteta had trusted gabriel and saliba more 
im not saying we should have done that im just laying out an alternate possibility to him staying and not getting minutes 
also ben white and gabriel will hopefully both start most calmness comes from that a make shift defense of cedric tomiyasu tavares and xhaka elneny and i might have a mental breakdown before and during the game 😅 
or that other plonker i can’t remember the name it’s a white male conservative who doesn’t like working people and wears a blue suit and tie all the time… actually i see your point shaun 
it's not even a dig at ben white and gabriel it's just a testament of how good saliba is this guy was good enough for arsenal since his first loan spell at saint etienne the club made a mistake agreeing to loan him initially he should've been in the team immediately 
no way they make f4 a bunch of white people on screen just now what hollywood wants anymore and for good reason i'd hope reed is still john but make sue johnny and ben poc 
but my question back to you is simple at the time we sent him out on loan would you say he was the worst or close to the worst cb option we had at the time remember we had not acquired ben white 
guys like xhaka ben white ødegaard nketiah martinelli ramsdale amp saka can carry the rest of the group through leading by action technical security to pin new back aggressive pressing to push them back when they have settled possession athleticism to get up the pitch etc 
ben white will most likely feature gabriel needs to pass a late fitness test 
it would be between saliba and gabriel for the lcb spot 
i will let it go this time 
spoilers if i see any of y’all treating sally the same way y’all treated skylar white after this episode imma throw something 
david duke does something similar just with the races reversed do you want to be like him amp evan ben 
people like ben crump wants instigation i think most people want peace and racial unity 
they wanted one of the storms adopted but clearly feared that it would seem like a trope for the black one to be adopted so they acted like a single black man would ever be allowed to adopt a white female child ben or doom should've been black

over the course of 2021 real madrid want saliba and barca rejected gabriel magalhaes now arsenal have saliba in their plans further arsenal willing to sell gabriel magalhaes is there a pattern to this 
nuno tavares debut season give a lad a chance ffs so u add elneny and he's put in better performances than partey and he cost 45 m

nuno tavares is in so show him up as we did the rest of their players in the week that was before he came on when we played newcastle the game only opened up when they got confidence from going 1 up so don’t let that happen assna can be frustrated aren’t devastating at all https t co qggzodsjb6 
however there's no doubt that their midfield pairing is vulnerable on the counter and the mobility and energy of bruno and joelinton could be enough to unsettle them whoever is running at nuno tavares will get plenty of joy and hopefully that's asm nufc

nuno tavares closing out asm with his left foot so the tricky frenchman can’t cut in is exactly what i would do too 
but are we being serious with nuno tavares 
hopefully mikel can find it within himself to give nuno tavares one last start in an arsenal shirt 
white and gabriel will face late fitness tests but i think they both play it’s more wishful thinking than anything there’s speculation amongst fans that nuno tavares could be starting but i can’t see it happening myself mikel clearly doesn’t trust the player 
cedric and nuno tavares are also raw but they do have some technical quality despite mixed performances this season the same applies to elneny these guys are capable of good performances amp one could certainly be complemented but 3 of them at once is a big big blow for arteta 
he led the team in progressive passes and was 35 forward https t co dwk6bqi84w

cancelo kdb son pep because he won the league it’s as simple as that 
alisson gomez konate matip tsimikas milner jones elliott minamino firmino jota even this will beat chelsea and win cup we not a team we are machines 
that touch today though when alisson played him a hospital pass was outstanding 
you heard it here first 
would go salah if not alisson but he has 1 goal from open play in his last 20 which is inconsistent kdb’s missed 10 games too so i went ali who’s played 35 and not put a foot wrong all season won pool so many points

great saves from alisson 3 points well and truly needed lets hope the last game doesnt come to gd we still need to beat wolves villa need to get something against city shame we have to rely on another team to win the title 😕 lfc ynwa 
awful game management from everyone except milner and alisson 
🥰😋 
still tyler sounds manifestly gutted by the 1 2 score yet southampton have a weird shot from distance and tyler sounds like he mayve bought the winning lottery ticket until alisson catches it 
alisson gets the pots on principle because the nominees are so bad that i don’t think any outfield player should get it 
alisson will be furious going for his second pl golden glove and they make a decision as bad as that why didn’t var check it 
would be amazed if gomez emerged for the second half limping badly as the teams go off alisson wraps a consoling arm around him

goal southampton have taken a very early lead through nathan redmond with a deflected effort into alisson’s net could that be the title decide 👀 
without the deflection alisson saves it as well 🤷‍♂️ 
just wanted alisson to concede despite the result 
slight deflection alisson would've saved that lool 
took a deflection off milner and flew into the far corner alisson no chance 
only matip and alisson out of today's team will start on the 28th 
alisson gomez konaté tsimikas milner and elliott i don't mind who let's do this up the reds 
alisson also should of had a rest think this means the end of ox hopefully son has a quiet game on sunday and mo doesn't lose his golden boot

also good taste since u like alisson becker🙄😩 
add bowen de bruyne son and dias to that too the remaining 3 places take your pick 
kdb is the one who has statpadded his way through the season by that logic alisson i agree he should be nominated 
best new player diaz with 7 goal involvements he's been great but sa has been another level all season 
what a beautiful words have liverpool wins this year's champions league we owe both cups to alisson for his save against napoli and goal against west brom to qualify unbelievable fingers crossed 🤞

ok does sound like joe gomez may not appear for the 2nd half which probably wasn’t part of the plan but drawn level and been the more dominant side liverpool really do need a 2nd sharpish though
