rob holding isn't bad … 
yeah let's get rid of the best young cb in the world because hey we have rob fucking holding 
rob is holding fast —resisting my need for more more more cuteness 
how do you justify rob holding stupid and unwarranted fouls that cost us the game we can't keep being a mediocre club it's best we gun for the top 
rob holding let the ball walk past him 
rob holding lying to people talking about massive progress it's arteta's best season as a coach not the teams best season 
bro rob you also reminded me of a safa president that was purportedly a one time preffered choice to replace 83 yrs old then ethekwini mayor imagine holding dual powerful positions simultaneously that according to fifa should be treated as water and oil 😂🙊😭 
rob holding's the reason we have trophies otherwise we'd be trophy less and without europe don't dare go there with blame 
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 rob holding 6 10 rob has had a great season the amount of games we've won wheres hes gone in and acted a low block as been superb villa wolves united west ham and more of course he's rating taking a huge hit after thag beyond stupid red card against spurs 
we were discussing arteta's in game tactics not rob holding but go off lol 
the denye person who qt'd me the panel of the person hulk is holding aint even black bolt but they didn't read lol 
rob holding is not good enough for europa league 
you all are pathetic one good game you turned them to elneny ruud gullit holding rob holdini cedric best 2 in epl on there bad days you all will come here ranting like animals they might not be as good as we need but keep same energy at there worst days too 😤 
from arteta and edu's arrogancy in the january transfer window to rob holding reckless challenge in the nld that cost us that game 
yes is into all things degenerate sexualizing children sex dystopia race theories and subversive nlp dogma anti religion potus is not into holding up our treaties with native america but subversive fluff pieces bc thats all it takes to rob you of your reservation 
definitely rob holding 
we should be adding rob holding to this conversation 
i am very much skeptical of claims and beliefs for which there is no evidence i'm actually skeptical of the people holding said beliefs but i don't trust people so there's that 
arteta doesnt make cedric push son making paul tierney giving a ridiculous soft penalty or rob holding getting himself sent off in the open 30 minutes once the players take the pitch they have to take responsibility cant blame arteta for our strikers not scoring enough 
ah yeah so the levels of cb go from rob holding to van dijk anything in between is useless 🤣🤣🤣🤣 
outside of bringing on rob holding in the 70th minute i'm not yet sure how he affects a game i'm hopeful things will improve though 
rob is holding the lemon 
you rob holding fans are obsessed with him more than arsenal the guy once again proved his level with everton's goal 
we need at least 4 players in this summer to be around the first team cf cm rb and probably another winger plus convince saliba that he will get minutes because rob holding is at best a 4th choice player 
more rob holding terrible defending today reminder saliba young player of the year in france 
allow pepe nketiah cedric rob holding lacazette to go 
rob holding 
i 4got ur a gunner sorry it had to be this way blame rob holding 
rob holding 5 10 except for the spurs game a few weeks ago he was pretty solid when he had to play i wouldn't mind him being sold but at the same time if he's staying i'm fine with that as well 
these rob holding fans love him more than they love arsenal 4th choice for a zero cap championship level player ballard is a much better player 
rob holding has more goals than them this season 
playing ucl with cedric soares rob holding nuno tavares alexandre lacazette elneny no thanks 
rob holding's wig glue i'm dead this deserves an oscar 
agreed us holding onto a lead is like trying to rob a bank without a gun we just get laughed at and fucked over 
yeah bro was just holding out for the last minute countinho winner 😂 we'll do it next week 
great run this season need to find a solid left back if tommy can stay healthy on the right get rid of laca and honestly don't care for elneny or rob holding 
rob holding utterly smashes the ball into the body of aaron ramsdale but the goalkeeper manages to clear it ramsdale doesn't look happy 🔴⚪️ 2 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
rob holding has made not just one mistake btw 
not hard when your up against rob holding 
did you see rob holding there 
yeah passionate dross like rob holding 
this team is looking to make progress in the last game of the season they have an elneny xhaka central midfield cedric and tavares at fb rob holding at cb and a departing striker up front in 
cédric soares and rob holding are good subs for a team who not have much money to spend nuno tavares was a waste of money 
rob holding left the ball wtf 
its fucking rob holding the guy is not good enough he should only play at the 80th minute in a back 5 
it's not 75 rob holding and 25 cedric ramsdale was not to blame 
yeah cuz rob holding is playing 😂 
rob holding decided we cant keep a clean sheet today is okay 
superb from rob holding just let the ball roll past you mate 👍 
no rob holding next season pls what was that defending at the end 
and neither should rob holding 
that was all rob holding why did he leave the ball 
😭😭😭😭 over saliba you know rob holding 🤣🤣🤣🤣 
rob holding tax 
rob holding is an awful defender 
rob holding and nuno taveres we expected to make champions league with them 
rob holding not good enough… 
what is rob holding doing my god 
why couldn't we just win against newcastle why did rob holding act so stupid against son and he's a professional footballer why 
rob holding too with his head like agege bread 
african rob holding askip 
rob holding over ben white 
i can just about look past the aubameyang and guendozi situations but if we don't bring in one of the best young centre backs in the world then compound that by keeping rob holding then i will be furious 
what's the difference uh the ball is there rob holding elbowed him with the ball in the air twenty feet forward 
why as every arsenal fans turned their back on rob holding 1 month ago he was holdini and now he's no one 
i think its more because we've had to witness rob holding again this season knowing we had a far superior cb out on loan 
rob holding 🤮🤮 
hopefully the last time i'm witnessing a rob holding start 
we got rob holding so it's fine 
rob holding 😝 
before holding onto the ball too long and then giving it away 
ok kid you clinch to your rob holding poster 
and it would have been done sooner without rob holding's performances and goal against west ham 
holding his red card vs spurs will leave a bad taste from rob's 21 22 season in many's mouths however he has been a solid third center back this season particularly to kill off matches in a back 3 an excellent deep block defender he's far from a bad player to have 
be less critical of rob holding lol 
you loaned him but you're okay with rob holding 
rob holding was renewed to have a squad and signging saliba dosent meanw e cant sign another cb every side has 3 quality cbs at least if you are playing in europe the only mistake club did was to freeze him for 6 months denting his confidence 
this is all because of our stupid manager now we're losing a top young talent in europe this shit board won't replace him it'll cost £80m to replace someone of his quality rob holding isn't even a 10th of the player saliba is afc going 1 step forward 2 steps back as usual 
the fa cup was a one off game where everything just seem to go right for rob holding that day and he shines at wembley as he won 2 fa cup winners medals and started both finals problem is rob holding is to slow for what we need now that's just the plain truth 
we got rob holding we good 
i do agree with the part where you said rob holding is too slow and that is true we must keep saliba it's not up to the player as he still under contract at arsenal 
rob holding 
so no answer on what happens to the luna we are all holding 
players wanting to play cl the guy has been pied off in favour of absolute dross it's embarrassing i can't remember rob holding having a weird revel video made for him flying down from bolton it's another case of lego head mismanagement 
if he comes back he's instantly probably our joint best cb … but don't worry everyone if he decides to leave just remember we still have rob holding 👍🏻 
rob holding is brilliant in a deep block but in artetas main system he's too slow on the ball and not quick enough 
with rob holding and mertersacker we won f a cup against premier league champion rob holding was our best defender during unai emery first season before he later got injured at old trafford 
so you'll rather rob holding in our back line 👍🏽 
arsene wenger started playing rob holding when he was 20 when he had done nothing in his career yet 
he is better than rob holding 
rob holding gonna stay and we are gonna sell saliba 
your fraud manager kept rob holding over him 
arteta does not rate him but favoring average english players like rob holding 
how can you be rejected by your own player 😭😭😭 rob holding bottled top 4 to keep saliba out 😭😭😭 
william saliba has not only done well but we also have defenders not good enough for the club how can rob holding be considered even an adequate back up for a big club' mikel arteta has messed up badly amp has got to go for this amp many reasons artetaout 
wouldn't you moan from a first team regular gets a £35m transfer has a great loan spell arteta prefers rob holding… 
salibas better than rob holding he should be in our squad end of 
the only two relevant games they played were against feyonoord and galatasaray and they ate 4 and 3 goals😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭 talk about standards rob holding would be maldini and sambi would be zidane in that washed league 
when they were sold the government should have retained a 51 holding of all the utility companies 
jimmy didn't do shit regardless😭rob was holding bum adebayo to 20 less points💀 
rob font allegedly landed more significant strikes then chito how did that go lol damage is the number 1 criteria it trumps everything clinch holding is near the bottom 
well for a starters you don't have cedric or rob holding in your defense do u we talk about first choice defenses not side pieces 
what are you holding rob out for is there something down the line im missing 
facts got me thinking was rob williams really holding him like that 
right now i'm coping with excruciating pain just holding onto hope that one day it will lessen take care 
beautifully and eloquently articulated marty sending love to you and to roger my greatest inspiration in baseball writing i'm at your old friend's son rob veno's wedding today with a heavy heart and holding my head up high 
vote for granit xhaka goal of the season now or roxy and lou will come for you gooners 😃👍🏻 
i have seen your post with those photos of them granit's daughters look great in the company of their father 😁 at least they have made you smile a bit don't you i like so much when you define yourself as lady xhaka 😁 
granit xhaka's for example was a good hit but never a goal of the season contender 
🇨🇭 granit xhaka 7 10 decent season for granit had his odd red in there but overall decent him and partey's partnership was so crucial throughout the season and its no surprise when you see the games we lost the majority of time one of them were missing 
ah yes signing granit xhaka is the sole reason why we aren't in the ucl you're a genuis ffs why can't everyone else see this 
15 million and the only team interested in him is real betis but yeah he's better than switzerland captain and head huncho of our midfield for the past 5 years granit xhaka 
so is granit xhaka but he's still got more goals 
you can say fighting spirit but granit xhaka came out after the newcastle game and said players didn't have the balls and didn't listen to the manager 
what is granit xhaka doing as usual 
a fantastic cross from cédric soares almost falls to granit xhaka but the swiss international midfielder just not quick enough to get there 🔴⚪️ 2 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
granit xhaka lets one loose from distance but it is well saved by asmir begović 🔴⚪️ 2 0 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
dele alli leaving a bit on granit xhaka after the ball had gone seems unlikely that the referee will not go back and at least talk to him 🔴⚪️ 2 0 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
but how i mean we have world class players granit fucking xhaka with 250 appearances lacazette who scores twice a season cedric so many world class players fuck sake i can't be arsed anymore 
bit of an issue bubbling between granit xhaka and former tottenham man dele alli tempers high and the referee needs to get involved 🔴⚪️ 1 0 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
norwich if you win today then we will let you have granit xhaka and lokonga for free 
you know who's shooting was terrible in the warm up vs man utd granit xhaka such a daft thing to attach any importance too 
my money is on granit xhaka 
granit xhaka red card 
thank god he's better than granit xhaka 
gabriel jesus to score granit xhaka to be carded 
you know rita ora dua lipa bebe rexha or era istrefi right they are astonishing the world with their voice what about the world champion majlinda kelmendi if you love football you probably know granit xhaka lorik cana xherdan shaqiri and many others 8 9 
tchouameni under poch will be like granit xhaka 
🇧🇪 albert sambi lokonga 6 10 again very solid 1st half of the season for a new player in a new league for such a young age but 2nd half of the season was never used arteta thought he could replace partey and do the same role of him but it was notbing like that at all 
almost five for arsenal gabriel martinelli plays a beautiful ball through to albert sambi lokonga but it is well saved to deny him 🔴⚪️ 4 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
alexandre lacazette 🥶 appearances 30 goals 4 assists 7 goals per match 0 1 minutes per goal 447 shots 46 shots on target 15 shooting accuracy 42 9 goals with right foot 4 goals with left foot 0 goals from inside the box 4 1 2 
olivier giroud has scored more goals this season then alexandre lacazette arsenal fall out with strikers the same way borisjohnson dumps his wife every few years coyg 
playing ucl with cedric soares rob holding nuno tavares alexandre lacazette elneny no thanks 
alexandre lacazette almost adds a 6th but his outside of the box shot is whiskers wide 🔴⚪️ 5 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
martin ødegaard gives the ball to alexandre lacazette who tries to whip the ball into the top corner but it sails very far wide 🔴⚪️ 4 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
alexandre lacazette almost has a goal of his own with his first touches but mason holgate does exceptionally well to get the ball away from him 🔴⚪️ 4 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
substitution it will surely be the final appearance in arsenal colours for either player as alexandre lacazette replaces eddie nketiah 🔴⚪️ 4 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
the amount of fans that cry about money and how much we spend on a certain player and his wages the amount that they cry about william saliba matteo guendouzi pierre emerick aubameyang alexandre lacazette look for every excuse in the dictionary😂 
player of the season jordan pickford moment of the season dcl goal v cp h game of the season cp h goal of the season gray v arsenal h young player anthony gordon most improved player alex iwobi most underrated player abdoulaye doucouré 
if was ridiculous matip pulled one on anthony gordon vs everton i was shocked something wey dem no even do salah before dem award am penalty 
agreed and deal in all seriousness i think you're a very good presenter and it might be my evertonian paranoia but it felt on the back of your comments about anthony gordon being a diver and a general dismissiveness of everton that a narrative was building on the pod wrt efc 
honorable mentions go to shelvey snapping anthony gordon al waleed getting left in brighton and gabby abonglahor's brentford rant 
well used to that with edited highlights strangely enough sky's presentation of our game v palace the other evening they edited out the ayew challenge on anthony gordon wonder why 
anthony gordon 
anthony gordon playing in a crap team 
richarlison dcl's goal against palace to guarantee safety crystal palace h demarai gray v arsenal anthony gordon alex iwobi alex iwobi 
5 promote players from the academy and interrogate into the first team anthony gordon will be a vastly better player next season for this year's experience need to do the same with simms dobbin price onyango

to be fair anthony gordon would play of course my mistake let's see anyway 🔵 
anthony gordon 
take a 4 for bringing in bruno guimeraes for anthony gordon 
what's the everton song book ellie 1 ohhh anthony gordon 2 spirit of the blues 
you deserved 3 reds got 0😂😂😂 anthony gordon should have had a pen but it saved off don't act like liverpool didn't get any decisions in favour of them 
ohhhh baby do you know what he's worth anthony gordon is the best on earth the silky scouser running down the wing he's the greatest we've ever seen 
anthony gordon of 
anthony gordon 
mate read what i'm saying on this seasons performance they're easily replaced evertonians blinded by players who try hard look at anthony gordon runs his balls off and this isn't a criticism as he's a young lad but has offered the team very little when you look at it 
brentford 56 goals conceded david raya gt de gea factos 
also maybe david raya for mendy but give him another season if we landed felix it would be crazy tho helps solve our creativity issues and i'd think he brings the best out of lukaku 
i fucking love david raya 
blue and white blue and white blue and white david raya blue and white he hates burnley 🔵⚪️ 
can we do a guard of honour for callum wilson and david raya 
can we commission a statue of david raya 
david raya only done that to send dingles down 
56th min 0 1 raphinha scores leeds utd take the lead as the brazilian slots home a penalty after david raya fouled him in the box 
david raya still blue and white 
goal brentford 0 1 leeds 56 mins huge goal raphinha converts from the spot after being brought down in the penalty area by david raya brelee 
goal brentford 0 1 leeds 56 mins huge goal raphinha converts from the spot after being brought down in the penalty area by david raya brelee 
david raya doing it though 😉 
yeah you're right he's not spain's backup in fact he's not even the backup's backup or even the backup for that if not unai simon then it's sanchez or vice versa if not sanchez then david raya and if not him well enrique even called up a u23 keeper to replace raya 
maignan sanchez raya all clear of david de jaal 
david shane her new pr guy who has multiple accusations of sxual misconduct fired from 2 companies of inappropriate behavior harassed a model he met on raya date app 
rico henry's too 
the what 
transfer in rico henry for a 3 game haul or captain kdb gw36 
ermmm ask ivan toney and rico henry's family about racists 
bowen trossard rico henry ward prowse 
yeah should've signed rico henry few years back don't think we will get him now doubt they'll sell 
no thanks he couldn't be arsed last time rico henry and that johnson from forest 
rico i💙u amp u r my guy at barstool but you can't really get away with calling guys skells until you apologize to henry hen ease lockwood come on we need mt ridemoore back before football camp starts we need the heart🫀 the brain🧠 amp lungs 🫁 back vital organs 
rico henry shots inventabet 
i am unsure on a statement signing but would love rico henry to add to left back with chilwell 
bought rico henry into my fpl this week you're welcome 
proper fan base… clearly not a nice one considering in the past week your fans racially abused ivan toney and rico henry got into scraps with vieira and zaha after pitch invading a 16th finish 😂 
rico henry 
on the plus side after today i wont ever have to see robin koch or diego llorente plus quite a few others in a leeds shirt ever again 
might stay won't worry yet won't know for a while but liam cooper like my tweet regarding pic maybe he knows 
they don't call him super duper liam cooper for nowt😂👏🏼 well done skip 
like with liam cooper and bamford 
liam cooper our captain 💙🤍💛 
he's just a shit liam cooper 😂⚽️ 
looks dodgy this he's not liam cooper 
liam cooper better 
liam cooper looking fine as ever 🤩🤩 
super dooper liam cooper 
i'd imagine guys like turnbull and ralston will definitely come back in but that's sort of balanced out by mclean and patterson being out definitely room for campbell or a liam henderson maybe all 5 of hanley hendry mckenna souttar and cooper get called up as well 
liam cooper is a liability in high pressure games 
callum wilson score liam cooper carded 
you have not just referred to liam cooper as a silky scotsman' i have heard it all 
liam cooper header for 1 nil win 
1 nil to leeds liam cooper header from a corner inside first 15 minutes 
cooper is a w ask 
whatever happens this afternoon for 90mins we must all stand up fight sing win every tackle hit the target win every header dig in and believe together fans players bench amp coaching team we can do this super liam cooper keepfighting mot alaw 
liam cooper flies 20 of his mates to vegas tomorrow for his stag do kp is also booked on his jollies amp no doubt others will be doing the same be interesting to see how invested they all are with bodies on the line or thoughts on not getting an injury that stops them going 🤔 
and 's dislike of liam cooper 
liam cooper amp lewis bate 😀 
or liam cooper

sam greenwood outstanding 
so proud of joffy leaves nothing on the pitch hopefully he and sam greenwood are an integral part of our future mot 🤍💛💙 
only one sam greenwood 
sigurdson greenwood etc 
who is the 4th i have the unnamed premier league player from everton greenwood and mendy 
what did you think of sam greenwood's performance today 
didn't think we would stay up but delighted to be wrong take a bow sam greenwood did his job 
sam greenwood was brilliant today 
even junior not perfect but some important stuff sam greenwood should take a bow though 
sam greenwood was so composed today so impressed with him but they all gave everything and apart from a few dodgy moments and nerves we played well 
sam greenwood 
is sam greenwood marking eriksen and playing cdm or are my eyes deceiving me 
its ok though as we got tyler 2 goals in his last 74 games😉 no dicking around eh young sam greenwood hes the man save us of course sheer neglience how can us fans understand no january signings criminal 
leeds i don't care about leeds i tweeted this because of sam greenwood 
your tweet was quoted in an article by calverleytoday 
i hope he knows what he is doing an experienced polish international on the bench and a first start for sam greenwood mot 
i hope sam greenwood rises to the occasion 
sam greenwood ffs 
sam greenwood vs christian eriksen a situation that sums up our season perfectly lufc 
sam greenwood centre mid doubt that we always played well in the 4141 tho 
sam greenwood starting a premier league footy game 
anyone know if sam greenwood will start 
new 10 already got him sam greenwood or mcgurk 
i'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse tierney nketiah lokonga leno cedric for cucurella and robert sanchez 
should have been phased out a while ago missed opportunity with henderson so we should be going all out for robert sanchez from brighton next summer 
we don't even have to buy someone this window man we have a more than adept keeper sitting on the bench to steady us until we get someone good like maignan or robert sanchez 
too much style like a celebrity yours save never be sticky likes robert sanchez should be spanish 2nd 3rd again real development is to bring in or another young magician i thought you and bruno is great but always disappoints at important times 
when de gea retired as always we lag behind in the hunt for nice gk like robert sanchez 
allison is amazing but robert sanchez good distribution but overrated shot stopper 
bro i'm genuinely wondering when you see alisson even robert sanchez etc and the quality of their distribution claiming crosses etc as well as being elite shot stoppers themselves do you not get somewhat jealous 
robert sanchez as backup keeper 
look at your goal difference that shows how shit lewis dunk 
lewis dunk is a sex offender 
lewis dunk as differential captain have a feeling he might smash a 40 yard free kick🔥 
just like lewis dunk is a victim of the england cb situation mings maguire and coady haha 
pascal gross and lewis dunk 
guys how excited are we for moises caicedo to get a full season this upcoming season i'm so hype for that 
reckon part of this deal should include you giving us moises caicedo for cucurella 
moises caicedo and cucurella understand each other too well 
would you guys answer some quick start sit gelhardt or ashley barnes tavares or rudiger guimaraes or solly march or caicedo thanks 
getting ptsd from the solly march day 
then i'll be snapping neal maupay's legs 
his first choice striker is neal maupay like starting the season with a 15pt penalty 
the neal maupay impact is actually insane 
that was the 19 20 season the season prior leeds fans got angry at a penalty and celebration from neal maupay then we bought jansson and leeds fans got really bitter and pissed off 
scum stuart dallas video neal maupay with leeds so they dont like us 
west ham will be leading 2 1 until a last minute neal maupay screamer 
• brighton striker neal maupay has scored in his past two games against west ham including an overhead kick in a 1 1 draw at the london stadium this season 
method right foot 14 left foot 9 header s 8 chest 2 own goal s 3 vladimir coufal 69' west ham v man city séamus coleman 37' everton v brentford benjamin white 55' arsenal v newcastle direct free kick goal 0 hat trick s 0 
the long term forecast is probably the best argument for them being a stat but it's still too inconsistent earl morrall has a higher win than dan marino len dawson higher than drew brees craig morton more than matt ryan phillip rivers matt hasselbeck higher than warren moon 
mings is one of the worst defenders ever craig dawson all day over mings mings is average sunday league player 
not better than big dan burn or craig dawson unfortunately 
that's fair and probably the best argument for them being a stat but it's still inconsistent earl morrall has a higher win than dan marino len dawson higher than drew brees craig morton more than matt ryan phillip rivers matt hasselbeck higher than warren moon 
two words craig dawson 
death taxes and craig dawson back post 
a craig dawson goal is needed for both west ham and fpl purposes 
congratulations to you both craig dawson specky definitely has a decent ring to it 🤣😅 
i'm joking mate of course i want to watch the amazing tactics of david moyes and the top quality from the likes of craig dawson against the top quality side brighton🤣 rather watch paint dry 
craig dawson will win a trophy before these two 
congratulations rebecca i'm sure young craig dawson will be a right little charmer 👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍 
van dijk after recovering from injury cancelo consistent trent and robertson consistent curacella good all season craig dawson ballon d'awse as we like to call him 😆 solid all season 👍 
mark nobles send off getting sent kate's shirt meeting craig dawson amp beating sevilla at home in europa amp lyon away 0 3 ⚒ 
dooooooooooods is going to allow that before carlos or tevez 👀😳 carlos dawson has a good ring to it 😂 or craig tevez 🔥 craig noble tevez💖😂 congrats to you both though 100 💖 
love it thank fook for that your money was the only thing keeping me from booting the cat 🤣 metaphorically not ina kurt zouma sense 
we're signing kurt zouma toosoon 
are you kurt zouma 
make una spare this guy oh he no get money like kurt zouma if those people enter him matter 
that's enough about kurt zouma 
hhmmmmm from what i saw the other night i would say more of a kurt zouma 
unbelievable jeff at the amex kurt zouma has appeared in a cat costume and has caught the seagull mascot of brighton in his jaws in an attempt to regain symapthy from the feline loving community hes been shown a yellow card for ungentlemany conduct 
when the kurt zouma cat video came out the location restriction was removed for the whole world to see because it involves a black man skysportracist

i feel ufo carries stigma for example i haven't heard someone ask you believe in uaps but they'll ask with ufos when english investigator and author nick pope was asked if term replacement reduced stigma he quickly answered absolutely 100 percent just my 0 02 
nick pope would be my choice 
nick pope is your first signing 
what a relief time to enjoy and rebuild and raid burnley at cheap rangers maxwell cornett burnley nick pope burnley burnley aaronson and a good defender 
should go for nick pope 
nick pope i'd say he should be prem and deserves it 
we must buy nick pope he is top quality 
that ship has sailed unfortunately cornet and nick pope now that would be ideal 
game can't have finished yet surely they're waiting for nick pope to take a goal kick 
have you noticed that they don't allow anyone to reply to their tweets cause they don't like the replies they get tories are not for the betterment of the people they only exist for the betterment of themselves 
that's one of the things with the conservatives the only thing they listen to is those lining their pockets i remember contacting councillors a while back over a problem i had non of the conservatives would speak to me 
would you take any players from relegated teams to spurs next season i'm thinking nick pope 👀 would be interested to see mcneil coached by conte too 
not even nick pope 
i'll have a fiver that it's lance 
so proud of our club players and fans today we go again next season💪 recruitment wise… let's raid burnley for nick pope great to have him and meslier fight it out for no 1 spot 🙏👍 
got some ideas for the summer window get some players like nick pope and james tarkowski who's contract run up in the summer hope you see this boss mot alaw💛💙

i would love the local conservatives to join in our twitter discussions in a positive spirit it's time people of all parties started to work together on local issues 
let nick pope find another club for his sake 
sorry nick pope for me ⚒ 
hope you read this ben i have had a business in the twbc area for over 30 years if you do not get together on a common cause to put tw back on the map and stop inter party squabbling you will lose control 
yourself and nick and all the pope family will always be in the claret family once a claret always a claret whether he is in a burnley shirt or not next season we owe him so much as fans his passion pride and ability kept us in it until the final day uptheclarets 
hi nick this is so much posturing you all run the risk of losing the public support 
if either of our keepers were to move on i'd certainly take nick pope 
she is very right 
nick pope 
can we please sign a goalie who saves something let me think nick pope 
wit burnley relegated any chance spurs will go for nick pope no i thought as much 
they should sell you man bring fresh blood myb nick pope 
yeh based on this we should buy nick pope 
also there is a debt and thats the big one from msd that needs repaying you also won't get 30m for nick pope who is 30 and has very poor distribution just be wary owning all your assets is great until the owners sell them to meet their repayments 
he can alot more so than nick pope 
nick pope 
sell nick pope to city 
sell nick pope to chelsea 
sell meslier get nick pope and tim krul for backup 
get nick pope 
him and nick pope on free's more money on rest of squad 
who cares we're getting nick pope 
nick pope from burnley would be a great signing 
seems a long time ago but it really wasn't gone horribly wrong since today wasn't as poor as brentford but some serious sorting to be done most of team today not good enough for pl we should be all over nick pope 
give them all to roma and exchange for tammy abraham who's had a stellar season in italy nick pope or sam johnstone jesse lingard tyrone ming's need a much bigger better squad for europe and assault on top 3 premiership 
both average nick pope better 
nick pope any takers 
nick pope from burnley has to be number 1 target 
honest to god leeds need to move heaven and earth to sign nick pope 
nick pope while we're at it 😂 
i'd take nick pope amp cornet at leeds 
nick pope nah mate got some swedish 3rd division goalkeeper lined up 
get cornet and nick pope on the blower lad 
we have shit defenders and a shit keeper nick pope would be first on my list 
think that will be addressed this summer to be fair i'd go after nick pope now burnley are down decent price for a very good keeper let dave mentor him and hopefully he will be ready to step in when dave's time comes 
a top class right wing back followed by a central defender and at least 1 more forward is the bare minimum this summer depending on who leaves obvs oh and nick pope 
sign nick pope for cheap 
and nick pope 🙏🙏🙏 
reckon we should try and sign nick pope now burnley are relegated 
nick pope will be back with fulham i hear otherwise burnley is a mess they picked up weghorst and immediately plummeted 
rather nick pope from burnley he is top class 
nick pope max aarons james tarkowski and charlie taylor should be top priorities 
nick pope should get burnley a decent fee a minimum £30m i imagine 
unlucky liam we fought hard today i can't see nick pope or tarkowski staying they are prob your best assets and i expect both to be snapped up by premier league sides 
nick pope man all day long 
nick pope 
i love nick pope so much thinking about he might leave us just made me panic …to crying seriously i am crying 😭 right at the moment then i just come up with that i fell in love with burnley 11 2017 and become a popey fan around christmas 2017 
charlie taylor would be a decent signing nick pope and james tarkowski should be brought in too 
me too we need proper defenders nick pope is a top 10 gk charlie is very underrated lb and tarkowski would be a decent addition to replace thos braindead cb's we have 
not enough trains there are probably more trains than are currently required 
i'd be after nick pope 
so i want nick pope to replace lloris who is too old and had as many as ten horrible games last year 
nick pope come to city next season 
brooo nick pope is the greatest gk of all time what ere you on g 
if kp and rapha goes we prob need 10 new players of prem quality nick pope starters 
nick pope 
nick pope 
yes def nick pope and id go for mcneill to 
nick pope 
and nick pope 
get nick pope for a fiver just to have him sit on the bench and watch how superior pickford is 
cnt forget what charlie did so a no go for me but i'll take nick pope 
nick pope 
what will happen to nick pope's future 
sign nick pope 
nick pope 
here they are captain bitter and missus salt nick pope will stay in the pl at least 
nick pope would be mine 
nick pope comfortably wasted five minutes in the first half last weekend and was never booked they got what they deserved last weekend and for the season 👋🏻 i wouldn't either but they're a horrendous bunch as last weekend showed 
start now nick pope bring him in take charlie taylor too then go on and sign more don't ever gamble with our club again but thank you 
nope nick pope all day long is first business i'd do 
yes yes yes nick pope would be an amazing signing one of the best in the league 
nick pope for me 
with burnley down i would bring nick pope in and sell henderson 
give us nick pope yeah for free 
with burnley down i would sell henderson bring nick pope in to battle de gea been one of the best keepers in the epl 
can we have nick pope please thanks 
i'm sorry mike jackson oh i am for real never meant to make nick pope cry i apologised a trillion times i'm sorry mike jackson oh i am for real never meant to put on a stellar performance i apologised a trillion times 
i'd be signing nick pope would help mealier develop and would be cheap also go after cornet 
nick pope 
and nick pope😉 
would be nice if we can get nick pope off burnley 
… or go and get nick pope 
you can sign nick pope atleast 😂😂 
hope someone buys nick pope he deserves a better team 
nick pope sarr 
shithouses hope they drop again nick pope got to get a move this summer 
now that burnley are relegated if our gk situation remains uncertain we better sign nick pope 
sign nick pope 
can we sell mccarthy in the summer or swap him for nick pope 
thank you the lady i spoke to said there weren't enough trains' 🤦🏽‍♂️ 
apparently there's a signalling problem in the tunnel 
he's a baller been burnley's second best player behind nick pope 
and then there are all the businesses that have set up in ashford because of the eurostar link to the mainland 🙄 
nick pope too… 
sign nick pope now 
buy nick pope 
nick pope is the better england number 2 
yeah no thanks to 10 asm has no clutch in his game nick pope had his easiest breakaway save of his entire career asm touches 7 turnovers 6 he pretty much would be great in the championship but not class enough for premier league 
goal burnley 0 1 newcastle 20 mins callum wilson sends nick pope the wrong way to put newcastle in front burnew 
get nick pope in 
nick pope is going full jimmy glass we'll be like the algerinos in 1999 celebrating staying up before he smacks a goal in and sends us down 
don't care if nick pope scores it as long as we win 
nick pope won't accept being 2nd fiddle 
if he's asked to be rested then fuck him off cannot be having that go and get nick pope 😂 
planet is on nick pope been amazing a class keeper bud he's bottom 4 
nick pope at a top team chelsea need him to replace de gea at man utd what do u think 
am supporting burnley today the likes of tarkowski nick pope weghost mcneill and maxwell cornet are too good to go down how the team with the thinnest squad amp budget survived for many seasons need to be studied at harvard 🤔 
i'm convinced i have better distribution than nick pope 
just can't see nick pope doing that 
matt targett and nick pope both to be carded today 
nick pope hands down not even a debate 
matt targett and nick pope both to be carded today 
100 percent nick pope 
this sounds much fun 
wouldn't it be great though if politicians were held to account and had to pay back even 1 of the public money they had wasted sunak and johnson would be rightly bankrupted let alone the tw tories who thought they were above scrutiny 
nick pope is their daddy😭😭😭 
nick pope to be carded 
yup i'm guessing it'll take a while to check all the allegedly dodgy deals negotiated and redacted payments hoping the signa'tories' to them will be held to account 👍 
same it should make signing nick pope a little less painful but potentially miss the better durty leeds players that may have become available 
in god we trust but its nick pope who saves 🤞🤞🤞 utc 
nick pope is a top english goalkeeper which he been proving throughout this season and we all saw how he performed against us the other day 
no bad blood there though a chant of nick pope get on our bus would be good 
watch the odds for nick pope depending on the score at brentford he's the best time wasting keeper around won me £85 at tottenham last week 12 1 with bet365 pre match 
if nick pope plays like he did at the villa you will be fine 👍🏻 
heard nick pope is getting a well deserved rest day can you confirm 
i feel sorry for leeds but i like nick pope so i want burnley to stay 
nick pope 
remember even our pope chose his nick because beatles were j p other 2 owls loving patriarch would go with sławomir waldemar or something 
i thought that spurs would have nick pope on their radar if so we'll take forster at burnley 
the power of social media some organisations respond differently when contacting them via a private route e g email telephone letter compared with contacting them via a public route e g social media newspaper 
i'll try to remember to look for it the next time i'm on the road i think national highways are responsible for the a21 rather than kcc so any signs are their responsibility 
nick pope if burnley gets relegated 
you can contact me at nicholas pope gov uk 
o checked google streetview it must be a new sign i've never seen it before a it's not in there it needs relocating to before the tw exits pembury rd or longfield rd 
hi nick that would be great thanks bmw customer services themselves seem to be being ignored by them so it'll be very interesting to see if your input can help do you have an email address i could send details to don't want to name individuals here 
actually there's too many aliens sightings or testimonies from credible witnesses around the world they like to orbit nuclear weapons stations check erich von däniken credo mutwa steven greer nick pope the phenomenon above majestic 12 the 5th kind etc etc 
we seriously need a good goalie if burnley gets relegated we should go after nick pope has been a decent goalkeeper 
what was the amount of the hostage money given by twbc to reopen they tried it on in several local boroughs with varying degrees if success i would love to have seen some breakdown or justification of these figures just to reopen a building they manage 
we need kamara in free and saul return could enough for this season in the mid field better to have mukiele soler and gaya if lodi leave is enough to invest and dybala to replace suarez and james tarkowski free transfer could perfect transfers season for us 
got some ideas for the summer window get some players like nick pope and james tarkowski who's contract run up in the summer hope you see this boss mot alaw💛💙

rather go for james tarkowski 
nick pope max aarons james tarkowski and charlie taylor should be top priorities 
charlie taylor would be a decent signing nick pope and james tarkowski should be brought in too 
no james tarkowski more likely can we raid burnley for brownhill whilst we're at it 
bring james tarkowski with you too 
alphonse areola nayef aguerd david raum ellyes skhiri play fornals or vlasic at acm either armstrong okoflex is good enough or he isn't hugo ekitike james tarkowski boubacar kamara on frees possibly lingard 
aston villa targets this summer according to john percy of telegraph are kalvin phillips yves bissouma joe gomez calvin bassey james tarkowski duje caleta car boubacar kamara matt targett morgan sanson bertrand traore anwar el ghazi 
• goalkeeper alphonso areola 10m • centre back james tarkowski • left back calvin bassey 25m • central midfielder kalvin phillips 30m • attacking midfielder jesse lingard • winger tete • striker emmanuel dennis 25m • any position eddie nketiah 
i like connor roberts but that just could be my biased side for the crynant cafu 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 
connor roberts injured just a fucking farcical decision otherwise 
itay shechter is our new sporting director and we're sending burnley a you jack burger in exchange for the services of one connor roberts 
connor roberts connor roberts was playing on the right hand side of midfield to show the lack of options available so it does sound tactical tbc etc 
i'm hoping this means we get connor roberts back 
pick up connor roberts tarkowski cornet and weghorst whilst burnley are in free fall please and thankyou 
connor roberts in a spliff mate 
de bruyne to score and connor roberts to be carded 
play connor roberts or pukki 
josh brownhill🤔 
klopp could go splash 20 million josh brownhill and you know what i couldn't care because he'd get a tune out of him 
really sorry for team brownhill pal josh has been fantastic amp his performances more than deserved to stay up he'll be fine 🤞 
connor gallagher armando broja calvin bassey james tavernier jesse lingard josh brownhill 
missed out on kamara to villa but sign josh fucking brownhill gsb out 
levi colwill lewis o'brien dwight mcneil josh brownhill billy gilmour 
that is from two weeks ago personally i don't think he's a pl midfielder i think he works hard breaks up the play well and has the occasional moment he makes too many basic mistakes he'll be a good lad in the championship 
dwight mcneil josh brownhill ismailia sarr 
been to both 5 plus times so was struggling to get excited at either just be good to see josh brownhill back at the gate if he stays there 
good riddance josh brownhill 
i don't think josh brownhill will be there next season think he will go to a prem club which will fund a bit of money but not much their own fault for getting rid of dyche 
josh brownhill would definitely be on my shortlist 
do josh brownhill to get a yellow card in the newcastle game 
callum willson ⚽️ josh brownhill 🔶 
luis diaz amp josh brownhill 
kevin de bruyne to score anytime josh brownhill to be carded 
ive asked sky bet to put this on bet on sky betting please burnley vs newcastle utd jack cork to be card josh brownhill to be card also lfc fc vs wolves lfc win amp btts no amp also lifc win amp under 3 5 goals leeds games eriksen 2 shots out the box leeds 3 cards as a triple 
can u put this bet on sky betting please burnley vs newcastle utd jack cork to be carded josh brownhill to be carded also lfc fc vs wolves lfc win amp btts no and also lifc win amp under 3 5 goals leeds games eriksen 2 shots out the box leeds 3 cards as a triple 👍 
🔶 burnley must match or better leeds result to stay up i think they'll sit amp play for the draw initially inviting pressure from asm amp guimaraes the midfield won't hesitate to make fouls to slow newcastle down jack cork to be carded 3 75 josh brownhill to be carded 3 4 
martin dubravka was an absolute brick wall against burnley send him a case of beer 
we literally have jamaal lascelles 
dan burn and even jamaal lascelles have also been excellent 
two changes for newcastle kieran trippier and jamaal lascelles replaces emil krafth and fabian schar respectively schar cleared to play after suffering a concussion on monday night is on the bench along with chris wood who's recovered from a hip injury nufc 
kieran trippier makes his first start since february against his former club for what is a strong looking nufc side the other change sees jamaal lascelles the captain replace fabian schar who is on the bench after the blow to the head he took against arsenal burnew 
its just banter dan burn sister 
i'd have said yes before we signed big dan burn but now we should be looking at one world class centre half to put it alongside him 
this the chris wood and dan burn that still finished above you 🤩 
seriously no way you're getting like £5m extra that's unreal that'll go to good use signing players like chris wood or dan burn😂😂 
no i don't have a second account i just write all my feelings out into a diary which i then watch burn weekly outside tp on a sunday night 
i think they were interested in him before they came in for dan burn 
i'm not having the left footed argument either because dan burn is left footed and been far better so if mings is in he's got southgates nudes 
not better than big dan burn or craig dawson unfortunately 
go and watch video clips off them both mane knew what he was doing dan burn is 8 foot high 
if you buy 10k of luna and everyone burning 10 of their buys makes it go up 50 because of an irrational market it's actually a very smart play luna gained 100 from a 6200 burn haha 
joelinton bruno everton or arsenal southampton for brunos goal and the fact hassenhuttl was livid haha dan burn absolutely love him me 
southgate has a lot of options in defence england have so much strength and depth if the season was still a couple of months to play big dan burn could have had a shout too 😜 
player of the season joelinton signing of the season dan burn best home win everton best away win leeds meant so much at the time most underrated shelvey ⚫️⚪️ nufc 
given all the high profile august flops was dan burn the signing of the season would dyche have got the result we needed' at home last game as a percentage how many football fans are idiots 
ppl wanna see the world burn 
i personally think we'll sign tarkowski for cb he's a right sided cb and would fit better with dan burn plus he's free 
yeah also blacc daddy and a few others i always liked dan the milkman but was so surprised to see him joining them on attacking me and charlie's london of all people at one point they were a force in indie comics they let a handful of ppl destroy them and burn many ppl 
dan burn moments 
dan burn was excellent again 
4 if you care about the community as much as you say you do then work with them to fix this just creating a new version won't succeed in the long term and it just papers over the cracks in my opinion best of luck i don't hold luna but more than willing to buy some and burn 🔥 
big dan burn how he fot under the rarer we will never know the guy is a unit 💪 
burnley will struggle imo norwich probably won't lose many players so will be up there not sure about the other lot although obviously i'd love them to crash and burn 
dan burn has been immense since signing fot also not so much under the radar but eriksen is amazing to watch 
hahahah burn it all people this is the luna burn address saveterraclassic 😅 
£90m turns the 2nd worst team in the entire football league in 2021 into the 3rd best team in the premier league in 2022 wow man utd arsenal etc must have wished they'd signed chris wood and dan burn in january 😂😂😂 
on the game today just not good enough pretty horrible performance tbh dan burn and bruno guimares we're absolutely elite for newcastle exciting times for them twitterclarets utc 
kdb and haaland transitions against defenders like michael keane johnny evans dan burn virgil van dijk and calum chambers 
joelinton big dan burn everton leeds krath 
joelinton bruno everton brentford big dan burn 
player of the season joelinton signing of the season dan burn trippier close second best home win everton best away win southampton guimarães 😍 most underrated krafth 
when did anyone say that dan burn had played for a defensive team we also had to make a different kind of signing then given our position 
i don't see tarkowski at newcastle now that dan burn has been a huge success they'll be looking for a young centre back to partner him 
it doesn't burn with them i'll survive 😂 i can cheer the team while criticizing how bad stephen jones is 👌 
probably best off letting eddie howe make that decision remember people saying the same about dan burn before he kicked a ball for us and he's been outstanding 
right who put ryan fraser behind dan burn 
we need to be aiming higher than better than lascelles though pal we need players that are comfortable on the ball he's just a poor man's dan burn burn and a ball player is what we need i wouldn't touch him personally 
we loaned a villa reject' and bought chris wood and dan burn trippier was injured after 4 games scored against you with a broken foot in that time 🤣 and bruno didn't start for 7 games 
the olehive will live on we'll camp in the mountains they'll never hunt us down they might burn our books they might mock our legacy at night we'll whisper in their ears 4231 direct pressing dan james on the wing unbeaten away record the night in paris pass it on hb 
everything just made sense eddie howe with experience dan burn quality bruno in the middle you guys f cked us though 
i'm expecting puns in relation to his battle with dan burn 
the fact that a loanee target and 25mil chris wood with dan burn at the backline is finishing above you in the league is so shameless 
dan burn and even jamaal lascelles have also been excellent 
just let dan burn take it idk 
lol i can't burn more than that i will play my own part and the whales will do thier own part the important thing is the willingness of people to show they want this project to succeed 
chen are you mentally ill we just need luna to burn and we dont need a new scam coin luna 2 0 
how dare you deny us the battle between 18ft dan burn and 18ft wout carthorst 🤣🤣 
and no chance of a community self burn etc etc get off the technicalities we are having this discussion because of you saying they weren't legitimate which is fud no one asked for your opinion you pulled this on xum and you publicly attacked the xoge phoenix with the same crap 
rpr at 1 and buy luna and burn it not the ust rpr current price 0 04 they manage to buy worth 7 000 worth of xoge 
gutted we can't see dan burn giving fraser a piggy back out before kickoff 😔 
you sign dan burn and chris wood we beat atletico madrid to boubacar kamara different levels 
we see luna we see do kwon we see hee tweeted a burn address what poor people want to know is this burn adress real they want some positive feedback because these poor are honest and want to help these guys are real but fake big money distroys hpes fast 
so even less so that's 1 20th with a 500k dollar buy in against a 11 billion plus circulating supply the reaper affect if priced at 1 dollar would be 20 thousands months plus at rpr 1 dollar to burn the whole supply so 5000 months to burn 25 of ust 
dan burn could have took that on his tiptoes 
george is actually huge birtley's big dan burn 😂 
ain't letting bygones be bygones cos i got a gun sit tight niggas gon leave u on the long run 24 karat gold call me the yung don they watch me balling while i watch em burn 
after the takeover i said to my dad 'there's no way they're going to sign brighton's dan burn ' 's big interview with big dan burn as he opens up on nufc release amp return blyth roots ant amp dec shearer amp his surreal 2022 burnew 
40 billion was removed from the collapse if rpr was at 1 dollar and they sold all their monthly holding to buy ust it would be 10 million dollars worth of ust bought and burned ust daily volume is 140 million a day 4 2 bil trading monthly against a 10 mil burn small drop💧 
do you think reaper dont have the capability to burn trillions of luna if rpr is at 1 we know it is currently at 0 04 im aeking on 1 price 
just gave out a luna burn address i have done my part we can do this lunatics lunaburn 
guehi was in the last england squad so am not sure who is underrating him… dan burn should be in there without him there's a good chance newcastle would be fighting it out with leeds and burnley tidal… 
imagine that in the prem they would get fly kicked by dan burn 
if current luna whales pick up on it and generously burn we may see this market run around like no other ofcourse this is just wishful thinking 
a town could lose their club because a few greedy men wanted to make a few quick buck from the pl gravy train amp no one will care because the pundits will be too busy focusing on newcastle having the cash to buy dan burn amp chris wood 
dan burn has to be in there zaha isn't under rated he just hasn't moved 
just gave out a luna burn address i have done my part e can do this lunaburn 
big dan burn can just run with him on his back 💪💪💪 
but he bought dan burn and chris wood🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 
do kwoon gave out a burn address i have done my own part let's see how it goes lunaburn 
all ticket burn over 16 5 odds has higher odds dan 2nikk 
dan burn definitely does and an england call up i would rather botman vs tarkowski though 
and dan burn deserves a full season there for me 
buy and burn luna 
25 million for chris wood 15 million for dan burn like i said it's not like we bought 5 world class players 
being black holed is the only way for certainty that's how black and white it is they are not black holed their business is monthly token sales to conduct their program they have to create to burn they'll need to create a lot more to burn luna with a desired affect 
oil money ours got us dan burn geeeet up lad ⚫️⚪️⚫️⚪️⚫️⚪️ 
could have signed 25 dan burn's for the signing on fee alone know which i'd prefer 
he also had a go about dan burn being happy to play for his boyhood club really don't see how he's made a connection or point from those different people he's had a go at tweets afterwards are just incoherent 
agree with wood on that but i like dan burn think he can be useful for them and at £13 mil ain't massive money in today game 
they buy luna they burn it you know how it works and having capabilities and doing it are two different things are you saying you're the only dev owner on the xrpl with integrity things are done differently in the states with permits licenses insurance bonding etc 
it's not an opinion i'm telling you they don't have the market cap to burn luna i'm also telling you they have the same capability as luna to create more tokens this is not a conversation about investments but miss information you've delivered more miss information than any1 
so it's the last game of the season and i would very much like dan burn to keep to his word and walk out with ryan fraser on his back please and thank you👍🏼 
jack his brother who used to share an east stand season ticket with amp who has been in australia since pre pandemic is the only burn family member yet to see bdb play for nufc but he's set to be at burnley today alongside other proud family members 
😆😆 what if what if city wasn't owned by oil rich owners would they have even thought of ucl football what if doesn't win football matches and luck isn't a prerogative of only a certain few clubs take your chances otherwise you'll grind your teeth watching your ass burn 
i don't personally rate big dan burn that highly but you do you 
i'm stuck between burn this disco out and dapper dan idk 
supply may have to increase for them to burn that much back into the 6900 billion then you can hardfork it all for 2 0 
same concept as being able to create multiple coins for use on an application or network they aren't building rome in a day needing multiple reapings to burn the supply as you're not either with creating new tokens 
sean longstaff jonjoe kenny malcolm ebiowei lee buchanan harrison burrows john swift all these players contracts expire in the summer 
watford a an absolute pub dog a sean longstaff screamer and a 90th minute jacob murphy howler… i was convinced that we simply weren't going to win a single game this season after this 🙃 
epl free agents christian eriksen  brentford sean longstaff  newcastle divock origi  liverpool eddie nketiah  arsenal mohamed elneny  arsenal roman saiss  wolves jeffrey schlupp  crystal palace daniel amartey  leicester pascal gross  brighton jordan ayew  crystal palace

miguel almiron managing man city with the formula 1 put crew headset on nice touch 
callum wilson has scored from close range after good work from allan saint maximin who rolled the ball to him on the edge of the six yard box turf moor is silent now apart from newcastle's travelling fans nufc 
salah has the stats and the 'beauty' as well might as well give the award to allan saint maximin because he can do a rainbow flick 
despite making his debut in february only allan saint maximin 9 has more pl goal involvements for this season than 🇧🇷 6 burnew 
2 5 using wood based projects and energy… do you mean wood pellet energy because if you are trying to claim that the wood pellet industry is carbon neutral we'll have to point the greenwashing finger at you again 
this the chris wood and dan burn that still finished above you 🤩 
seriously no way you're getting like £5m extra that's unreal that'll go to good use signing players like chris wood or dan burn😂😂 
chris wood charlietaylor and peacock farrell the grass isn't always greener lufc mot 
have some shame we haven't spent nearly as much money as you yet also you have kane and son we have chris wood and fraser 
must be awkward for chris wood to find himself in the away dressing room 🥹 
that is why i love chris wood from newcastle the last time he played west ham he would meow at zouma everyone they were close west ham complained 😅😂 
i do miss wood green fred i hear he sells vintage east yorkshire pottery these days… 
that £900m we spent on chris wood doesn't look like good value 
yep now we've guaranteed safety thought you lot liked chris wood but as soon as he left you lot hate him 
1 joelinton 2 kieran trippier 3 arsenal 4 norwich 5 chris wood 
chris wood plays for newcastle 
no chris wood 
leeds fan here i'm sorry our gain comes at your expense but that is the nature of the competition i think a bit of empathy and goes along way rather than gloating when it could so easily have been us best of luck next season p s will take chris wood back np😂 ✌🏾❤️ 
give yis chris wood and dwight gayle for 20 million 😂😂 
why did the club need to take a loan out in advance of getting the next chris wood installment 90 of your income came from tv money if you don't bounce straight back then i can't see anything but struggle you're average squad age is nearly 29 that is going ti need renewing 
chris wood will be happy he jumped ship 
chris wood has been absolutely class when it really counted 
that chris wood money must be a comfort now 🤦‍♂️ 
how many players did they buy just 3 trippier from athletico madrid chris wood from burnley guimaraes from lyon and then targett on loan from aston villa will you say they are world class players c'mon eddie howe did extremely well he took them from 19th to 12th 
pay the debt off with the money we get for mcneil cornet and pope and we are debt free and still have the parachute payments to use which im sure they will as new owners bought cornet and weghorst we still made a 12 million profit from chris wood 
oi any chance of buying chris wood back 
good riddance man shittest football club to have ever graced the premier league did nothing but play hoofball for a decade and moan about having no money when they got money they bought another chris wood with better technical ability no creativity just pure brexit footy 
just give them chris wood back on a free 
eveen better that we sent them down cheers for chris wood 👍 
really wanted chris wood to score the goal that sent them down but i'm still ok with them being gone 
£90m turns the 2nd worst team in the entire football league in 2021 into the 3rd best team in the premier league in 2022 wow man utd arsenal etc must have wished they'd signed chris wood and dan burn in january 😂😂😂 
no we won't we had to take out a bank loan to pay this month's wages whilst waiting on the funds for the chris wood sale to newcastle that isn't due to nxt year 
i just don't get why you sold chris wood only to buy the dutch chris wood 
chris wood the only player to have played in that squad the only one not to go down 
what is burnley fans beef with chris wood 
you'll be decent back up for chris wood next season mate 
top players would never choose a small club like newcastle and most definitely not want to live there that's why whilst we sign top players like coutinho digne and now kamara they have to settle with shopping in burnley for players like chris wood 👍 
book blurb take this chris said handing him a ten inch knife inside a leather sheaf i brought it just in case the knife had a carved wood handle and was sharp enough to shave with mays hooked the sheaf onto his belt were you expecting godzilla you never know 84 
we bought our way out of trouble ha we got targett on loan chris wood 2 goals an ex non league centre half from blyth trippier broken foot after 5 games and bruno didn't accrue more than 90 mins total until the end of february one man galvanised us eddie howe 
i think so phil that takeover and the debt plus i'm not sure how much money you'll make out that squad who knows though you want chris wood back 
chris wood finished above you 😂🤦‍♂️ 
i'd argue that selling chris wood to a relegation rival in january was a more costly and stupider decision look what's happened on that front 
if anything chris wood smoking as well lmao 
same wish every year 😂 happy birthday chris 
you will never be forgotten or replaced kammy won't be the same without you you take care of you a true legend 🙏👏🤝💙 
eddie howe chris wood kieran trippier 
your players were dirty playing so yous deserved to go down bye bye 👋 👋 👋 but you can have chris wood back if you like haha 😂 
no chris wood no sean dyche no prem league brexit football is gone from the league 
we loaned a villa reject' and bought chris wood and dan burn trippier was injured after 4 games scored against you with a broken foot in that time 🤣 and bruno didn't start for 7 games 
as a good will gesture newcastle united will return chris wood free of charge nufc 
good absolutely ridiculous that he didn't get top 4 even after signing chris wood any manager worth their salt would have easily managed to get about 33 goals out of him since january 
chris wood says the championship isn't so bad 
chris wood he left cause your shit 😂😂 👋 👋 
afaict chris wood did fuck all at newcastle but losing him absolutely sealed burnley's fate do they get 3 more points with him in the team ofc 
chris wood sent you down

i got cooked for saying that even chris wood would look world class in this liverpool team and bag 15 goals a season same story with jota 
step up chris wood your chariot awaits haha 
the fact that a loanee target and 25mil chris wood with dan burn at the backline is finishing above you in the league is so shameless 
is wood sellable 
chris wood own goal to give burnley a win amp relegate leeds heard it here first 
a late chris wood winner sends burnley down 
yes he can and it's not like all the opposition teams have chris wood upfront like jota firmino havertz jesus armstrong and more ain't target mans 
haha chris wood to sink his old mates 
you can just see chris wood to come on and score last minute to take burnley down can see it now 
pontus jansson will score an own goal for leeds at brentford only for chris wood to cancel it out with an og for burnley to send down leeds 
chris wood with the second 😂 
chris wood scores sends burnley down 
wouldn't chris wood coming on for a 93rd minute header to win be great 
clearly lined up for a move smacks of chris wood being protected before his move to burnley only more pathetic 
chris wood is going to send burnley down in the 89th minute 
two changes for newcastle kieran trippier and jamaal lascelles replaces emil krafth and fabian schar respectively schar cleared to play after suffering a concussion on monday night is on the bench along with chris wood who's recovered from a hip injury nufc 
then chris wood prefers leeds over burnley 
what you gonna do if chris wood sends you down 
chris wood is on the bench against his former club after recovering from a hip injury with callum wilson leading the line for nufc again emil krafth is among the subs replaced by trippier while federico fernandez is also among the replacements burnew 
absolutely here for chris wood coming off the bench and scoring to relegate burnley 
you sign dan burn and chris wood we beat atletico madrid to boubacar kamara different levels 
sorry but i hope your happy place is not happy for you today the mighty mags are coming to spoil the safety party chris wood to score the winner and maybe a goal from trippier too howe ay the lads 
that's what i'm hoping for 0 0 park the bus for us and a chris wood header last minute for you lot booom 🤣👍 
newcastle 1 0 burnley chris wood 92 
getaprice leeds to stay up raphinha anytime scorer chris wood anytime scorer odds please 
chris wood and matt richie that finished how far above your shambles 🤷🏻‍♂️ comedy gold 😂😂😂😂

chris wood 
we've been here before and we will be here again chris wood to score the winner against burnley and bamford to come on and score the winner for us off his arse 
con gol de chris wood 
played this over in my head about 14 times we need goals i just hope we are not relying on chris wood to help save us 
your signing of the season luis diaz flop of the season weghorst and chris wood underrated player of the season son team of the season liverpool manager of the season eddie howe 
nah chris wood is clear 
😄 i reckon will be alright ya know got a feeling chris wood will send burnley down 
good chris wood hattrick and trippier brace incoming 
chris wood winner 
a town could lose their club because a few greedy men wanted to make a few quick buck from the pl gravy train amp no one will care because the pundits will be too busy focusing on newcastle having the cash to buy dan burn amp chris wood 
eddie howe has pledged to name his 'strongest team' this afternoon injury concerns over chris wood hip and ryan fraser hamstring while fabian schar has been following concussion protocols this week and may not be involved nufc 
chris wood for me ⚽ 
prefer you to lose wood with the winner burnley fan headbuts him and then gets battered with saint maximin 
they won't put all their eggs in one basket like that he's an unproven 19 year old imagine if he flopped for whatever reason and we had wilson injured again hello chris wood won't happen mate 
whilst villa shop in barcelona for world class players like coutinho newcastle shop in burnley for players like chris wood levels to this game wee aaron 👍😭 
nah he has actually been worth the money he is probably going to be club captain next year and has made a real impact in the games he has been on chris wood on the other hand was a pure panic buy and most of the fanbase wont mind if we leave him in burnley today 
guys can we leave chris wood in burnley we dont need him anymore 
but he bought dan burn and chris wood🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 
a pontus own goal a red card for a rash challenge and leaving the pitch doing the leeds salute would help chris wood knocking in 3 would be brilliant we'd probably still be at 0 0 in the 8th minute of extra time before meslier runs up the pitch and heads in the winner mot 
my dads a fan so hopefully you can get a point and chris wood sends burnley down 👍 
spent 12 million sold chris wood for over 20 million 🤷🏻‍♂️ 
chris wood brace as he and eddie howe exact revenge against burnley 
but chris wood is better than tammy 
chris wood shearer volley to send burnley down 
who you got matty targett n chris wood aaaaahaaaaaa🤣🤣🤣 
i really hope you are right and will go with 2 1 asm wonder goal and chris wood to put them down 
mate you look about 5 stone chris wood could pick you up and use you as a kite 
chris wood own goal in the 90th to send leeds down 🤣 
and eddie howe kieron trippier and chris wood 
chris wood 
chris wood 
chris wood 
chris wood was key to the team in that 9 game unbeaten run closing down leading the line an outlet to hold up play and bring others into the attack stayed fit big pressure penalty vs wolves without him we'd be lower down league fantasy football fans with short memories 
chris wood on the loons 
dear mags please dont play chris wood today as he wont want to score and risk the wrath of his old fans in a pitch invasion 
chris wood 
aaahhh that old chestnut trippier plays 4 games guimaraes hardly played in first few games after he signed chris wood hardly scored what about the improvements shown by joelinton fraser shelvey longstaff krafth almiron but does that not fit your narrative 
25 million for chris wood 15 million for dan burn like i said it's not like we bought 5 world class players 
chris wood with the last minute winner to send the burnley boys down 🤞 
chris wood will keep us up 🙏🙏🙏 
chris wood 
and chris wood scores the goal for newcastle and our 2nd goal is a 90th minute og by jansson haha 
chris wood to huddersfield pal 
chris wood winner 
hoping for a hatrick from chris wood against burnley… 
chris wood is going to be starting for blackburn rovers next season 
we lose to a pontus goal and charlie taylor equalises to get burnley a point after chris wood is sent off early for newcastle that would be the leeds way for things to go 
new ht entertainment that'll be mate players who can't get sold on get the chop literally just hope we get 2 wow signings this summer like you'd did first propa window we'll have this summer coz january was rushed and we panicked at the end chris wood 
kagawa come on there are so many better options even someone like chris wood deserves to be in there above kagawa 
we need chris wood to score like weatherall vs liverpool back in 2000 🙌 
chris wood 
i've still got my chris wood case 
looks like fun my wood pile is lacking compared to the one you had 
happy to say this but chris wood is relegating yous 
chris wood 
the chris wood derby 🤣 
ahhhh thanks you can see how much attention i'm paying to it biggerfishtofry 
the michaela documentary is on itv today at 10 15pm hence nick is rightly pre empting twitter being 'busier' than eurovision night 
chris wood 
4 3 chris wood 95th minute header to send burnley down 
chris wood 
the problem at sky is not just the murdoch's it's the appalling lack of talent on the payroll credlin chris kenny paul murray and bolt that's a lot of dead wood to carry 
trippier around 16 mil great business bruno around 50 mil chris wood around 25 mil dan burns around 15 mil so just over 100 mil my point is spanish ffp is too tough to the clubs and english ffp is implemented flexibly as it should be 
chris wood clear 
strange that we call then cult eu remainers can't see the wood for the trees 
chris analyst skills are as good as his basketball career lol 😂 the dude is trash on and off the court garbage 🗑 that shouldn't be on the air all of them are wood riders for the celtics and hate miami teams always a huge bias against miami 
picture this both games are 1 1 heading into injury time leeds are minutes away from being relegated on goal difference in the 94th minute chris wood heads past pope full time signals burnley are down newcastle actually fulfill their master plan of weakening burnley 😝 
i was right chris wood sh te 2 goals in 16 matches is pathetic for a striker and trippier out injured good coaching got you out of it 
was chris hansen the one who caught jared 
225 for 10 hours in a smoker apple cherry wood after 4 hours i cover the oitside with a sweet maple bbq sauce and let that bake on there 
i got you todd they actually don't take long to make it's just coming up the scrap wood squares i got the brass and dowels already it'll be a fun thing to work on this summer i'm excited to get them out to everyone 
chris wood to real 
chris wood here we go 
i wouldn't worry too much newcastle paid £13m of burn and £25m for chris wood 
bring varane in when we have to play against chris wood but other then that shouldn't have too many problems 
brentford 1 1 leeds bamford to score anytime burnley 0 2 newcastle chris wood to score anytime requestabet 
no edouard mendy replaces courtois it goes like alisso mendy maignan 
player edouard mendy score 59 100 where do i even begin after last season this was just simply dissapointing started well but the second half of the season he was no different than 18 19 kepa costed us games single handedly hoping he's back to his best next season 
brazilian duo of alisson liverpool and ederson manchester city ends the season with 20 clean sheets each followed by hugo lloris tottenham hotspur 15 and edouard mendy of chelsea with 14 clean sheets fb 
i present you edouard mendy de gea and fabianski yeah pope's not a particular good kicker but we've progressed past lumping it to benteke now 
i choose senegal 🇸🇳 they won the african cup of nations the team consists of one of the best wingers sadio mané who plays for liverpool and one of the best goalkeepers edouard mendy whose also a chelsea goalkeeper believingismagic 
stat race for the golden boot pl this season mohamed salah 22 heung min son 21 cristiano ronaldo 18 harry kane 16 race for the golden glove pl this season alisson 20 ederson 20 hugo lloris 15 edouard mendy 14 aaron ramsdale 12 
start telling me the prices they got this guys hazard sanchez camavinga edouard mendy tell me one english paid big for excluding the renewals of contract after their improvement in the english league😏 non of them were gotten €60 
hakim ziyech 6 5 10 another magician who has had another average season had an excellent spell at some point in the season and got dropped out of nowhere since then he's been average if we switch to a 433 next season i'd like to keep him as a rw if not then sell keep sell 
hakim ziyech that is a wish not a possible list 
last premier league oppo player to score past palace at selhurst was hakim ziyech on 19 2 22 
player hakim ziyech score 64 100 this is probably the toughest one didn't play consistently looked average but then had an insane spell before being dropped for no reason scored some absolute bangers that actually made me enjoy football a little 
if you see this message will inter milan buy hakim ziyech⬛️🟦 ziyech ziyechinter intermilan inter 
hakim ziyech and pulisic will be here next season 
mans chatting about maths you know do you understand what goals assists per 90 even means mason mount has 0 83 g a per 90 hakim ziyech has 0 51 g a per 90 meaning ziyech for example respective to his less minutes has less output compared to mount comprende 
differential punts ⭐️ hakim ziyech 🔵 the morrocan looks set to start in chelsea's gw38 fixture vs 19th placed watford although he hasn't started that much this season he has got himself 4 goals and 3 assists from 13 starts in the prem he could be a huge rank booster this week 
only mason mount has hit double figures in the premier league romelu lukaku has eight league goals kai havertz has seven callum hudson odoi has one christian pulisic has six and hakim ziyech and timo werner have four apiece 
your darling manager dropped ziyech when he was on form so how can you blame him for not producing more 
se u get i no like that malang sarr for anything even as center back 
why will this guy go to play for lampard i don't think he will learn much will do well to have him in the squad ahead of malang sarr 
second should be malang sarr follow by rlc jorginho n pulisic 
4 losses vs us this season with a team containing malang sarr 
better than malang sarr 
malang sarr 4 10 not good enough for chelsea football club should leave us this summer and make space for colwill sell 
malang sarr also came free tis quite a web my bros 
malang sarr being at chelsea is just a description of our awful season we need a mass overhaul in the summer our squad is littered with soo much dross around 
we've also had malang sarr and chalobah bail these youths from the end of the day it's a man's job we are talking about if the new owners are comfy with the inherent inconsistencies that comes with fielding yutes it's cool 
we sold tomori and got malang sarr frank lampard really did us dirty 
i have seen some casuals tell me malang sarr is decent to have in our squad for depth next season if this genetic engineered bozo is anywhere near our squad next season then we're not a serious institution 
malang sarr is our worst defender bruh 🤦‍♂️ 
i hope is seeing this now malang sarr is what we later settled for tuehh 
congratulations bro i told them that the boy is destined for greatness imagine a club that sold tomori and kept malang sarr 
watched malang sarr cock up for another goal today while tomori's lifted the serie a title 
you gave me less heart attacks than malang sarr and marcos alonso so fair play 💙 
malang sarr and harry maguire are in the same entertainment group 
you will still come back and tweet this if the club sign another young defender and malang sarr join a winning team i don't blame the board decision to let the young player test their talent elsewhere if we can get them back to the club fine if we can't get them back fine too 
we have got malang sarr tho 🥺🥶🥶🥶 
imagine we allowed tomori leave only to have malang sarr whoever did this to us should be crucified 
everything is cool but why malang sarr just not score damn 
that's very ambitious actually when you have malang sarr as your only lcb 
malang sarr the only outfielder to not find the net 
so malang sarr no see anything score 🤣🤦 
people are legit making a case for malang sarr amp co man 
nope there is malang sarr at home bro 
please don't come back next season with malang sarr mendy kante pulisic mount 
worst player of the season goes to malang sarr 
we literally have azpi almost costing us the game to malang sarr losing us the game 
who scouted malang sarr 🤣🤣 
yeah malang sarr is taking home 120k saul 200k kai 315k timo 270k ziyech 120 what a marina masterclass tuchel should be sacked 
wtf is wrong with malang sarr 
got the malang sarr special lmaoo 
this malang sarr guy isn't a footballer at all 
malang sarr is the worst ball watching ffs 
malang sarr can't continue to be a chelsea player next season 
can we release malang sarr yet how fucking embarrassing are we 
dude malang sarr oh my days 
malang sarr last game i hope 🙏 
it's a little jarring kenedy was always a smart option off the bench this season but we wasted our time trying to make malang sarr lwb work 
definitely much better than malang sarr 
a chance to play with malang sarr 😩😩 
people wanna play the kids who had to be bailed out from relegation by malang sarr 😭 
so did malang sarr bro let those lads rest they have preseason to impress in 
are they fuck lol malang sarr played with the youth squad last week and looked world class 🤣 
how did chalobah make it i ask by praying that kounde's 60m would fall through on deadline day opening a spot at 5th cb b c that was it and even then being benched for 20 games in a row when we trotted out malang sarr vs arsenal 
you do know cobham boys were recently fighting relegation and needed malang sarr and chalobah's help let that sink in because i'm pretty sure you had no idea 
the academy needed help from malang sarr and chalobah to fight in a relegation battle 😭😭 
never have i ever seen a malang sarr rep 
how tf is malang sarr not starting 🤣🤣 
malang sarr has better ball control 😂😂 
so our 4 defenders are leaving and you want boehly to get neymar for tuchel ao that tuchel can start playing malang sarr and chalobah as our primary cb 
me anytime i see malang sarr😭😭 
plus an additional malang sarr for only 9 99 plus shipping and handling saleout everythingmustgo 
malang sarr for you my friend for free 
last game will play imo depends on the rest of the squad if there's going to be significant rotation who knows one malang sarr can cost you a cs in a second having said this alonso can score assist any time i expect havertz to play so can pay off james i'd steer clear 
if malang sarr or marcos alonso can make chelsea team especially with their non football ball sense then levi colwill is good to go highly rated young skillful full of energy and good on ball we need him 
malang sarr ross barkley lukaku and loftus cheek would be ideal 
vim they make up for it with some nice plays at least but this guy i speak of is the malang sarr of celtics 
malang sarr is better than levi colwil at the moment i'd rather keep sarr than have colwil in the first team 
he can get malang sarr and odoi on loan 
priorities we can't spend 200m on our attack in two summers when malang sarr is the only lcb remaining 
malang sarr is free since he signed him hell we could even throw timo werner in there 
he can gladly have malang sarr 
we can give them lukaku amp malang sarr is a bonus 
goalkeeper kepa arrizabalaga another player who may leave stamford bridge could start while the likes of malang sarr and saul niguez could be given some minutes youngsters such as harvey vale may feature but tuchel is unlikely to take any risks with werner's hamstring injury 
not 13 don't play fifa quotes don't mean shit if thierry henry or xavi or pirlo said malang sarr is the greatest defender of all time i guess they're all correct are they 40 assists in 20 years bring your statistics to the table now 
smh delusion finally has a face 
so 4 5 with liverpool makes it a farmers league but 8 11 with madrid is not hahahahahahahaha your'e being childish now 
lol you are stretching your logic out of proportion how does barca winning the league 8 times in almost a decade with teams like real and ath mad present not a farmers league do you even understand what a farmers league is 
you ignored it and ignored other context and an example because it showed you your logic was wrong 😂 whatever makes you happy tho 
problem is your fact supported my take that's why i say you are pointless pity it'll take you forever to figure 
i gave you the facts and you chose to ignore them 😂 
there's nothing you can actually do in the first place you are pointless 
man if you wanna ignore facts context an example etc then there's nothing i can do 😂 
no floor yet but i would love your support ape nation nft collection is giving away 10 whitelist spots to 10 of the first 1000 to join our discord 🚩follow 📢like and retweet tag 3 friends 🏛join our discord 
god's law 🤔 
you didn't answer the question king e max 
the tweet you are referring to means nothing and proves shit a farmers league is when a club dominates the league bayern barca ajax rangers etc did it and now city are doing it same thing rest 
nope 
still you can't win with by 0 0001 point yourself rest 
4 out of 5 is a complete farmers league even if they win by 0 0001 point try do the same and stop capping 
i'm sure you're talking about basketball 
i'm so f king proud of him ❤️❤️😊 
you guys act like ruiz didn't dog walk joshua 
king of play to earn lets goooo axie 
has joshua king even made a run yet get rid of these heartless mercenaries 
that bernardo silva own and that joshua king i swear i won ment that day 😭 he'll now make one normal save and exaggerate it to fool and captain my foot 
you'll never beat me i am the ratio king 
snivelling sidekicks always seem to get it in the neck eh joshua 
they're literally kissing the ground madrid step on how tebas still remains the league president is beyond embarrassing for the entire league 
so true man laliga shouldn't even get involved in this it's embarrassing 
yeah just like mbappe to madrid didn't happen stop wailing like kylian was your birthright if they broke ffp it's not laliga's place to report them their league or other teams in their league should tebas and perez should rest with their eye service 
would you swear amp cuss in your prayers to yah why would a nation which is said to be a wise amp understanding ppl need to be cussing as a light to all nations amp representatives of yah does our actions reflect our great king👑 anything or any ruock against yah is considered sin 
damn if only we had the same pull as the kings of europe 
he was good bruh he saved a joao pedro chance that could've easily gone in 
just like joao pedro jorge molina doesn't deserve this 
cagliari did not score and it costed them big time they deserve to go down because they relied too much upon 36 year old joao pedro 
😂🇮🇹´s striker woes i'm following the salernitana and cagliari games on the day balotelli scores 5 goals i remember the not so distant past where joao pedro was the solution to italy's wc problems 
brownhill joao pedro sarr pope tarkowski aarons pretty much it 
mancini called up joao pedro over this 🤡 
no one to summer transfers personally i'd go for tarkowski gilmour and joao pedro 
instead i had to watch berardi immobile joao pedro and insigne crimes against football 
cdt sub joão pedro hits the bar with a header from a free kick they're not throwing in the towel this tondela side 
tough match for utrecht but gustafson didn't score bad actually now hopefully a big match from joao pedro to save his cagliari team 🙏🙏🙏 
tzolis 🇬🇷 20 winger dennis 🇳🇬 24 striker joao pedro 🇧🇷 20 striker a bit unrealistic but some top talent at the wrong clubs all know how to score goals and need a step up from the championship 
full time failure at the bridge with a familiar ending there is upside however for next season in joao pedro cucho gosling and kamara but that is about it we'll see what edwards can do—if he is allowed to do it that is watfordfc youorns 
pedro poro strong link with joao felix girlfriend 
everybody dislike pedro porro card on futbin just for joao

leak pedro porro and joao felix showdown card 
i actually prefer joao pedro as a signing not the finished article by any stretch but as a longer term option would be my choice i disagree on plans a b c game winning rescuing adjustments are pinpoint and doesn't need wholesale tactic changes imo 
we gon boycott pedro porro card to discard up joao felix 
joao pedro with a 35 yarder tomorrow☑️🤣😭 
tyrick mitchell is a full back keep up 
no i was with linda for some of her campaigning and this is bullshit she respectfully acknowledged georgia's advantage she was not bitter both indeps had a role in shaking things up unfortunately in hughes people will vote for a broomstick if it has an lib label on it 
palace fans dislike the guy and they like will hughes 
mailloux paradox will be solve this summer it will be an elc after camps or i believe he will be offer up in a trade for someone's first round draft pick most scouts had him at around the 15 or so pick last year hughes can get a 16 32 pick my prefer hope is keep him though 
this one dier jonnie swallow oo😂😂 bite will not be enough 
the most amazing job ever done in hughes we stand by you and we will follow you always for no woman has ever inspired this community as you have 🧡🧡🧡🧡 
if you also don't have too much time to go through everything try and listen to their therapist's deposition that was played in court plus maybe the psychologist dr curry and probably the latter will give you an idea on why some people still believe her 
love that it will only confuse her to give her a new name post adoption if she answers to mildred or grammy just stick with that 
your going on asif its vindictive away fans at someone else's ground it's our own fans at our own ground we had just won the league on the last game of the season stop fishing the goal will be replaced 
and what makes you the expert on saying she has it she has 0 evidence even her psychologist dr hughes ended up admitting she beat johnny up it scares me women are defending abusers like amber men will never have a chance to come forward 
leave him where he is nobody will vote lib if he is the leader actually hughes people would 🤪 
oh nice i will definitely check this out i saw a video from someone in dr curry's field and he talked about how apparently heard's scores according to dr hughes didn't line up with curry's conclusion and also how unprofessional it was of her to go have dinner with him wild 
what are the chances you will turn into this generations howard hughes 
the wages of sin is … god will deal with these nation wreckers one by one 
too much money is a very dangerous thing i suspect he will succumb to some of the obsessions that we've seen in people like howard hughes and randolph hearst human beings are not cut out to be so powerful 
how important is it to get the partner of the future for hughes at least in the system soon do you feel it's more likely that player is a ready to go now piece vs a younger player who will require more development 
give them a hug our pride start june 1st and ends with the festival weekend june 24 26 and my son will be volunteering as one of the asl interpreters 💙 
some of these holes will probably be filled at the draft table and maybe some will be filled by trades i can see hughes and gorton wanting organizational depth at every position 
modern day feminism got y'all thinking too complex or is a mindset of scarcity while y'all limiting your blessings its woman like her with the abundance mindstate that will continue to outlap y'all that limit your blessings based on the or way of thinking vs the and 
45th min mike moser feeds the ball into space for josh hughes he beats his man and smacks the ball off the near post that will be the end of the first half score 1 1 
i feel like this is the beginning of the movie aviator where senator brewster started going after howard hughes and dragged his reputation through the mud elon will come out on top in the long run imo 
what's funny is if we say slim thick a group of twig ass females will be on the tl like no bitch can you read slim thick not slim stick tf 
maxi hughes will get tickled and cuddled just like james dickens did 
you're talking about a british level fighter against a world class fighter barry will style on max hughes 
two poems will suffice and death shall have no dominion dylan thomas and the horses ted hughes a verse of the red flag nobody knows more than one god should not be unduly bothered on my account 
i would guess what will happen here is maxi hughes will get retired by barry 
jt is going to be significantly more expensive in term amd aav than rust and someone will pay it i just hope its not the canucks i like the player but locking him into a commitment like that when he doesnt fit the age of the hughes demko petterson competetive window 
premier league crystal palace vs manchester united substitution crystal palace 82' off 12 will hughes on 18 james mcarthur

truscott will be playing with hughes again next season but will be in a top pairing role with 2021 22 top pairing owen power and nick blankenburg moving on to pro hockey love to hear that 
unfortunately and it really bothers me to say this they've waited too long what will end up happening is will going to lose seats in the house and senate and they'll end up just dropping the investigation 
totally agree a 3 yr contract will flexibility would be great maybe hughes was talking about all the 5 7 yr contracts bergy gave out at silly money 
are yes and the press will cast it all as biden's failure to restrain them the negative biden administration pieces are too easy to see i wish they'd spend even half as much time writing talking about the coming end of our democracy 
i've seen one will probably see a few more jack hughes was still in diapers the last time you saw one and it's not looking real good for you to see another 
i will agree the rest apart from laura hughes were nutjobs regardless of the other candidates though barnaby will probably never lose 
chris hughes 9 is hatching an escape plan he knows will never work not that he cares imagined elaborate prison breaks are like caffeine at this age daydreams that have a near absinthe rendered quality 
hughes gorton sedgwick have all spoken at length about the importance of analytics data with the recent hire of boucher it's clear that the habs have moved on from the old school ways and will be taking a modern approach to this draft 
sorry i have a thing about men's shoes i hate to see men in pointy shoes or shoes with thick heels example the british actor tom hughes and will smith are at least 6'1 they have huge feet and always wear the right shoes with low heels sexy as hell

the deal will see the esa antenna system also integrated into the platform presumably this will be a smaller version than the proposed solution for larger commercial aircraft fortunately the antenna is modular and flexible 
great piece marco this helps providing a better perspective versus all the negative surtounding wright… i guess this will come doen to what hughes is looking for as a 2c … 
the movement started before bitcoin so i don't hang my hat on bitcoin for the failure or success of cryptocurrencies if bitcoin fails to carry the baton into the future others will beauty of open source 
if the rumours are true that he'll earn 700m over the next 3 years money will literally cease to be the slightest concern for him so why would you think he'd stay for even more when more money would change nothing for him 
it is also about lack of connections to upper management without their support nothing will change 
i remember watching your videos through lockdown thinking about how much i missed the theatre you were amazing hope you make the final and if you do i hope you sing you will be found 😁 
additionally felipe cruz joins dcfc from benfica more of a nod to the future with my scouts raving about him but provides comp to kenny at right back also will hughes rejoins from palace to provide comp and experience in midfield 
great effort condolences kelly is done be interested to know the informal in hughes let that be a lesson in preferences matter most people follow the how to vote to the letter you just got schooled in touchy feely choice will never get you elected 
shame of it is that the electorate has voted for a light weight who barely bothered campaigning amp will have the influence of an ant they had a real chance with to make a difference for hughes but self interest of the small bus owners and property inv won out 
next year p3 it will be full of dangerous potholes 
exactly indie protest votes from normal lib voters might go 1 indie 2 lib so if indie finishes 3rd those 2nd prefs will flow to lib but no flow if indie finished 2nd i will check the final pref flows in hughes to see if this stacks up we haven't had much real data before 
good read exciting to see if advertisers will be able to make the most of what web3 has to offer thanks for sharing and the mention 
why not big slovakian winger is going to be a stud by year 2 or if mtl passes on shane wright or draft 1 of the right shot d that could partner with hughes for the next 10yrs if nj tosses in another asset or 2 then cool but i think most will be happy which 2 
i think we signed someone called wayne rooney 2006 £30m from everton w brown academy 1998 to sunderland 2008 £2 3m will hughes left on a free william prunier maybe from a french team 
while it doesn't always work eg nicholls in vic getting the indie into 2nd place is critical for indie to have a chance in both hume and hughes indie looks like finishing 3rd b4 prefs if it stays that way it will be interesting to see how indie prefs flow 
my parents voted you no1 they are devastated your effort did not go unnoticed or unappreciated you offered a lot of hope for hughes it will happen someday 
jenny is a great candidate and will be a fantastic mp for hughes 
yes many parallels between hughes and musk i suspect the future trajectory will be interesting but i sincerely hope collateral damage is minimized 🍿 
bridie just because you are a neurologist or even journalist does not mean you will be an effective politician different skills and a different intelligence needed you need to be more wily than wily coyote as was billy hughes paul keating had been a clerk in county council 
with only 7 of the vote in hughes he will need 15 pallets on a space ship to have half a chance 
possibly hes yhe 21st century howard hughes except he isn't handsome has no personality and not as smart hh musk will end up as insane and isolated as hh though 
think of howard hughes living in one hotel room for 15 years endlessly rewatching ice station zebra hughes once a pioneer in aeronautics became an early explorer of the existential terrain that cyberspace will open up 
given the ft disparity in this one i suppose you can't be sure how this call will go down 
not the worst thing in the world hughes will discover how irrelevant they are with a representative unlikely to be in a position to change much might teach them a lesson 
100 million spent by palmer to gain sweet b gger all not only did he fail to win a single seat his pm in waiting kelly received less than 10 of the vote in his seat of hughes the billionaire wannabe coal mine developer will have zero influence in our new progressive nation 
i predict that someday soon elon musk will be in jail how's that for a prediction but probably not before trump is i also predict that he'll have a complete breakdown before that probably within the next 3 years i also predict he'll go the way of howard hughes not pretty 
take out paps and hughes out of their team and they struggle papenhuzen is the real deal then top that with nas and welch out of their pack and smith and jennings from their back line can understand why they struggled bad cowboys will be top 4 this year very solid team 
yup but garbage takes are precisely the only things yascha traffics in the same article over amp over ad infinitum ad nauseam the 2024 coup attempt will be successful this time amp he'll still write the same boring bullshit claiming false equivalency on both sides 🤷🏻‍♂️🤡🤦🏻‍♂️ 
perfect fit if hughes can make a deal with the devils and get their 2nd pick vs petry subban won't be resigned 1st pick from calgary and mailloux coz it's over for him with the media we have 1st and 2nd picks this year everyone will be happy wright 1st

two players should win it this time david de gea and cristiano ronaldo 
brentford 56 goals conceded david raya gt de gea factos 
david de gea 7 5 10 one of the highlights of the season which his famously good shot stopping ability and even some penalty saves this season however his distribution looks weaker than ever and with the announcement of eth this surely will be an issue to address summer 23' 
that's where david de gea comes in 
3 months without seeing david de gea on my screen 
thanks david de gea you did the impossible along with 
please exempt cristiano ronaldo and david de gea thanks 🙏🏾 
this season david de gea has made 146 saves in all competitions alisson 92 ederson 74 3 times manchester united player of the month 1 time premier league player of the month probably our player of the season thank you dave ❤️ 
why spain is not referring to him as my keeper so why are you be more ambitious man raise your standards… united need a world class keeper david de gea is not 
goalkeeper of the season david de gea defender of the season joao cancelo midfielder of the season son striker of the season mo salah coach of the season thomas tuchel flop of the season player grealish useless club of the season arsenal 
this statement by david de gea are true ✅ and immortal ♾️ you don't know the pain and heartache this shamble of a season has caused me🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ the embarrassments are finally over📌 
david de gea literally threw the entire team under the bus but apparently its impossible for a bloke with far more power 
🚨🎙 david de gea i cannot wait to play under erikten hag i am excited for the next season new manager new players hopefully we will improve and put mufc in a better position we need to trust in the future 
i want to forget the david de gea era it has been horrible a very bad time for united in all ways it has been very tough it is time to find a new goalkeeper 
he's thinking how is david de gea still our keeper worst keeper in the league 
i get why david wouldn't want to say this out loud about his team mates but honestly who could blame him for thinking it the amount of times we'd have lost if it wasn't for de gea and ronaldo 🤯 
there were more valleys than peaks if individual performances are discussed everyone should be ashamed sans a few hungry heads including ronaldo david de gea and who i don't know it has been too long since lifting the 20th title all the rivals are closing in 3 4 
most of the top reds don't even rate de gea they admire and think maguire is the focal point of being the leader in this team ronaldo and david have been very driven and vocal in their assessments 
david de gea tried his best god bless you david for everything you did for us you are the best goalkeeper in the world 🌎 ❤️ 
david de gea simply the best goalkeeper in the world huge giant fan and still love the club win lose or draw hope next season will be better ggmu 
so it's not okay to post anything about david de gea out of context but it's okay to post cavani out of context aye 
it's just the agendanistos blinded by their bias they ignore the good to focus on the bad and create an alternate truth and that truth is that without david de gea's contribution this season we might very well have been in a relegation scrap 
david de gea my king 
very useless set of players aside david de gea and maybe ronaldo no manchester united player can be in manchester city's first eleven 
seriously how much does david de gea pay you 
pathetic players except cristiano ronaldo and david de gea europa league football for eric ten haag what a way to start your journey in depleted team carried by the aforementioned players but still ggmu mufc ❤️⚽🤞✅ 
david de gea you are destroying our club 
6 cristiano ronaldo – £480 000 per week 7 kevin de bruyne – £350 000 per week 8 eden hazard – £381 000 per week 9 philippe coutinho – £380 000 per week 10 david de gea – £375 000 per week source dailypostng 
3 10 those 3 marks are for cristiano ronaldo david de gea and the fa youth cup winning team things can only get better mufc 
guy i swear you can't disagree that ederson is much worse at goalkeeping that david de gea but look at him winning golden glove if you're defense is shit there's nothing you can do as a goalkeeper 
10 it was a fantastic holiday for all players except david de gea amp ronaldo ps harry please quit 😅🤣 
de gea saw demon this season 0 gd 🤣 
and he de gea didn't create any fuss about this he stayed humbled and was okay being benched people need to remember ot was roaring david de gea we want you to sign whilst he sat on bench he was immense before and after the fax thing too 
everybody has played a part in the way this season has gone nobody not even david is guiltless nobody should feel like they're blameless they're all to blame this is a team but i'm willing to excuse de gea he wasn't the worst out of a bad bunch 
she thinks david de gea is the problem making a joke mocking him about the whole fax machine incident as if she wasn't celebrating when the deal fell through back then it's easy to act smart about something that happened 7 years ago hindsight is a wonderful thing eh 
david de gea had more saves than allison and ederson combined but yeah its about clean sheets harry maguire 
thats david de gea next captain 
what does it have to do with dem this is not a comparison it's a clarification as to how david de gea is also at fault for the bad season man utd had 
no you act like dean henderson is on david de gea's level that's totally fine though i guess we just have to wait and see who eth prefer out of those two 
david de gea el es un hombre con integridad un profesional un jugador real the most important man on the field is the goal keeper and he should be protected with blood and sweat what a legend that man is 
did he's currently at the police custody now please let's all help in any way we can please let's get this to trend investigatetherape golden boot david de gea man u cancel investigatetherape investigatetherape 
david goat de gea overall pls 
did you hear what ddg said david de gea ones who want to stay stay at the club ones that don't want to stay go out you don't have to stay here mulive 
the tweet is about david de gea though everyone has been shit and the team has conceded 57 goals with 0 gd whilst mr captain material is patting himself on the back and pinning the blame on everyone else why would i talk about anyone else here 
david de gea woke up and started throwing punches i like it 
17 david de gea another that splits opinions personally i think he's been good this season and arguably our player of the year same issues still with his distribution and sticking to his line makes his position under threat but shot stopping 2nd to none 7 10 
david de gea ones who want to stay stay at the club ones that don't want to stay go out you don't have to stay here mulive 
david de gea i want to forget this season and be 100 ready for next season it has been horrible mufc 
me too am shot of worlds even there was a time alison becker was totally out of form but liverpool still stick with him support him even david de gea chelsea fans we need to be patient we're winning it all next season 
even david de gea is talking about players with good character that means ralf rangnick is right 
🗣 david de gea the best thing that happened today is the season has finished 
🗣 david de gea i want to forget this season and be 100 ready for the next season and be positive it has been horrible a very bad season in all ways it has been very tough it is time to rest and prepare your minds for next season 
i dont have to watch david de gea kick a ball till august 6th 😍😍😍

gareth bale and david de gea in one image 
premier league crystal palace vs manchester united goal keeper manchester united david de gea image credits supersport 
it has only become more evident as time progress that culprit in majority of united problems over the past decade is david de gea as he is about the only constant remaining since his arrival in 2011 as this skinny teenager that refused and still refuse to learn the basics 4 4 
me when i see david de gea taking a penalty next time 
what a cross claimed for david de gea 
ronaldo and david de gea are the only players carrying united right now the rest of the players are lazy 
handanovic had been immense year after year season after season such an underrated keeper when the likes of david de gea were falsely given best keeper in the world monikers by epl little englanders i feel the time is right to start looking ahead now though 
he deserves better than half you fake fans the guy has carried us without him we'd probably be bottom of the table fighting relegation ronaldo and david de gea are the only ones that deserves to wear that badge so you lot need to chilling slagging him off in the comments he's 🐐 
many manchester united fans would love you to do an honest david de gea assessment this season as it is causing an unwanted divide in the fanbase thanks in advance 
please can i get that article were he called david de gea that…wanna show somebody 
imagining de gea being shielded buy city chelsea liverpool defence without fear favour or prejudice david de gea is magnanimous he's the best off all times 
🇪🇸🗣️ david de gea about this season mufc 🔴 manutd 
for the betterment of the team man utd should drop david de gea 
shouldn't have given him captaincy as soon as he signed for united david deserved it i truly think united thought he was gonna be their answer to kompany or virgil he's a little above average and only 'turns up' for international games ronaldo or de gea deserve captaincy 
david de gea is experienced enough to analyse his own performance only ronaldo can touch him rest r shit and you know this 
jayson tatum david de gea 
diogo dalot 4 10 feels like dalot's pr reputation is better than how he actually performs maybe better suited to a top 5 league which isn't the pl and with less defensive responsibility danjuma gave him nightmares in the cl 
he's staying the story continues and the post was liked by his sister and diogo dalot 
scott mctominay diogo dalot victor lindelöf alex telles i don't want to see them next season 
go to your leagues section and check from there 
8 diogo dalot broke into the first team and started okay but 2nd half of the season proving he's not good enough to play for the club 4 10 
go to your leagues section and check from there 
same here 
try website maybe it'll be there 
can't open to see who's got the points 
diogo dalot worst defender in the league 
what is a diogo dalot 
15 goals for wilf now this season he's just too good for you chant the selhurst fans he was certainly too good for diogo dalot and victor lindelof in the united defence so easy for him to get past and through them porous cpfc 
twisted and turned to find some space and then shot through diogo dalot's legs into the bottom corner palace fans sing he's just too good for you cpfc 
but matip got zero epl this season same as harry maguire too 
harry maguire hate space 
so you think that harry maguire is a good player 🧐 
son is among the most criminally underrated footballers in pl history he's what the english press would have u believe harry kane is if his name was stephen maguire they would've said only pele might be marginally better in fact son amp kdb are the only pl players worth gt £70m 
karma for disrespecting harry maguire you 🤡 he is in a long and happy marriage ❤️❤️❤️❤️ 
but you were okay with solskjaer getting backed with £400m for 3 years including locking harry maguire in a room until he signs just go enjoy retirement man 
win or loose i go still carry my head up de walka make harry maguire follow me make we see 
harry maguire he plays a key player in the national team and you do not play this is unfair in the history of football love you brother ❤️ 
erik ten hag has decided to never put harry maguire in the starting eleven again and has told close mates he will be stripped of the captains armband immediately source 
watch southgate take harry maguire over him mentally preparing myself for this 
respect the best cb in the world harry maguire wow 
better than harry maguire 
respect harry maguire please 
of course she's cute but i can't imagine a situation of myself taking all bants just because harry maguire decided to take a bow for a mason mount's shot leading to a goal 
harry maguire was 80m anything less than that for bastoni isnt fair 
no harry kane jack grealish harry maguire or luke shaw 
gareth watched harry maguire's match 🤣🤣🤣 
harry maguire is the worst footballer i have ever seen in my life i watched gabriel obertan uno 
all the states governor's are worst in different ways but you see abia state governor that man and harry maguire na the same 🤦 
aye with add ons maybe another 90m signing with harry maguire involved get rid of him asap 🤣🤣 
harry maguire 3 10 i refuse to believe that maguire who was in the wc and euro tott is a fully lost player and his passing can certainly be used by eth however his season has been nothing more than diabolical with mistakes all over the park and his confidence rock bottom 
put in the hard work over the summer harry we'd love to see a hungry maguire back 
i respect you so much harry maguire the same way i respected bruce robson keane and cantona solely because you are manutd captain as i don't know you other than that but come on you need to start getting more vocal and leading by example you've got this respect ggmanutd🙏👏 
awwwonnnnn sir harry maguire hope to see you next season at manchester united 🙌🏿🤩 
harry maguire the squad take full responsibility and we know that what we have shown is nowhere near good enough for this club also harry maguire lol🤡 
you are better than harry maguire john stones tyron mings amp ben whites sadly you won't be picked by southgate because he doesn't rate congratulations pal much deserved 
harry maguire and phil jones lmao 😂 
you know manchester not united o manchester city they're the champions and i'm harry maguire the only captain in manchester 🤷‍♂️ 
harry maguire haven't you guys maguired us enough 😭😭😭😭 
one of the few people who can look up and be proud of their performance one of our best players and captain my skipper harry backenbauer maguire 
the squad take full responsibility not harry maguire the captain 🤡 mufc ggmu 🤞 
to inflate the market you pay above market value r9 zidane figo all bdr winners all superstars you don't pay 80m for harry maguire for example 😀 or 50m for jon stones 
and their homie harry maguire 👀😂😂😂 
spanish harry maguire 😂😂 
🌕 one prime example was when a meeting was led by cristiano ronaldo rather than harry maguire this made rangnick uncomfortable seeing that the captain of the club was not included rangnick eventually ended the discussions relatively early 
michael keane harry maguire defending right there 
harry maguire is literally england's best player don't group him with them lot 
harry maguire 
how is it nonsense do you honestly believe after paying £80 million for harry maguire 3 years ago manchester united will once again break the record transfer on a defender whilst maguire is still at the club and utd are under the glazers ownership 😂 
why look at a young up and coming cb when you can carry on choosing a dog shit harry maguire in dog shit form 🤷‍♂️ 
i wish eth doesn't waste time in axing some of them out mc fred telles dalot awb harry maguire and elenga needs to leave 
not tyrone mings but it's impeccable for harry maguire to be in that squad for the world cup 
this harry is better than maguire 
phenomenal because he doesn't have harry maguire and co in front of him 
they honest to god need to stop playing harry maguire 
player evaluations are a bit skewed aren't they i mean harry maguire was bought for 80 mil there is no comeback from that… 
boris johnson will be calling harry maguire to stay at man united too 
and that's why you should have harry maguire 
thank god for cristiano he made this ass hat have a few wins here and there i feel bad for manu fans harry freeken maguire was captain over the goat thank you ralf my ass

harry maguire 
pogba and harry maguire 
as a liverpool fan i have to say that's rather mean 🙂 but i console myself with the fact harry maguire is your centre half that eases the pain slightly 
we spent as much in january as ye spent on harry maguire 
they need a right clear out i'd say 9 or 10 of there first team players starting with harry maguire 
if you can sell harry maguire three times at a go pls do that guy should be at the gate collecting tickets

draw harry maguire my idolo 
sounds like when u told big al that harry maguire had a crap season 😂 
he's also the manager who bought harry fucking maguire and made him a captain 2 weeks in bought wan bissaka instead of cancelo ignored donny had zero tactics and is one of the biggest at fault for this season shit house aoart from the players and the board 
harry maguire and luke shaw were in good form 
the worst is just a temporary blip time to rebuild around harry maguire and consolidate such failure 
harry maguire met ole gunnar solskjaer in his office after his transfer from leicester city amp explained his history as a player in efl amp pl ole smiled and said words to the effect of you'll be the captain of manchester united fc son mufc ggmu 🤞

harry maguire and kepa arrizabalaga are the most expensive defender and goalie… even if they were when he signed them but that was 4years ago… your point is flawed…

if harry maguire had a good midfield infront of him he would be one of the best 
get rid couldn't care less if it's on a free i'd pay a team to take him and throw in harry maguire as a sweetener 
david de gea had more saves than allison and ederson combined but yeah its about clean sheets harry maguire 
tearful and disappointing season where everyone at the club from board to players should be ashamed of themselves also conceding 57 goals in a season shows that harry maguire is a big problem in defence not solution smalling is far better than him 
low budget harry maguire 😂 
man u liverpool chelsea city spend lots of harry maguire is trash amp is the most expensive defense in history grialish 100m and doesn't even play im a pep fan don't get it twisted he's a cule and i like his style u still support mou and i'm not calling you a roma fan 
harry maguire of arsenal 😂 
how he's going to loan harry maguire to one afghanistan club for 5yrs then sell him later 
and the saddest thing will be that he ll be dropped for harry disaster waiting to happen maguire 
but southgate still thinks fikayo tomori is not better than tyrone mings connor coady or harry maguire 
harry maguire's younger brother looks gutted 
true but i can still appreciate quality and these days city amp liverpool exude it as did the class of 92 with utd and fergie its the vitriol from some i don't like maybe i'm just getting old ok i am still look on the bright side you still have harry maguire 🤣 
bruno fernandes is your vice captain signed a contract till 2027 harry maguire captains your club also 😭 
honestly good for you and your football club when the club i support is becoming a joke and is cursed now they look like a commercial club like what louis van gaal said to ten hag about his warning it's a mess in old trafford and greater manchester cough harry maguire 
he tried to dive against harry maguire he deserves slander 
where's harry maguire 
they also did not win a single game this season without harry maguire 
57 goals scored 57 goals conceded cristiano ronaldo will be scoring and harry maguire will be canceling them out so they can balance out my team man united is a joke 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 
23 harry maguire shocking season for the skipper never got any form and was made the target for the fans maybe the arrival of ronaldo effected his role in the dressing room and was undermined needs to lose the armband to save his career 2 10 
because they have harry maguire 
harry maguire 
banter club's harry maguire and his europa league skills are much better 
pretty sure they both have 2 although that's pure speculation on my end in all seriousness i do appreciate him being willing to talk a bit more openly and candid but he does have a lot of similar issues to harry maguire if we are being real 
harry maguire looks sad 
according to fans marcus rashford edinson cavani paul pogba wan bissaka luke shaw jesse lingard and harry maguire did not perform for manager ok but didn't we had a big squad not taking mg11 to consideration don't we have one of the best academies in europe 2 n 
enjoy harry maguire

what part do you think i'm not grasping 😂😂😂 harry maguire is far better than calvin bassey mate that is a ridiculous thing to even be discussing 
harry maguire 😅😅😅 
no amount of state backing and commercial financing can make manchester united successful with harry maguire at the back 
harry maguire's a b in this guy's book

bee team… make una start harry maguire today 😂😂😂😂 
harry maguire 
haha he literally says he's not blaming him and ronaldo isn't a pressing monster that's just a fact the sad thing is that ronaldo bought into ralf's style more than say rashford luke shaw and harry maguire did 
harry maguire is getting his hands on that trophy fella ✌️ 
tbh this all started when psg paid 223 mil for neymar since then the game has become more about money rather than performances harry maguire 80 mil coutinho 130 mil hazard around the same price and don't get started about griezmann 
lol i hate manchester i don't watch their games 😌 but harry maguire is their asset 
harry maguire mcfred rashford cut price 150m

this just proves the amount of saves you have to make with harry maguire playing cb 
harry maguire get good 
i repeat a team that finished 2nd in the previous season with harry maguire as a regular starter 💀 
so you'd rather have harry maguire amp tyrone mings ahead of thiago silva raheem stirling ahead of vinicius jr aladdin neymar amp fabiano walk into an england team 
crazy old men he will never criticize harry maguire that's why cristiano is signing a pre contract in portugal today with x teams from the world elite keep watching 
harry maguire should come and learn from you 
at least stam is much much better than harry maguire 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

harry maguire is available for free 
martial and harry maguire real madrid will br unstoppable 
harry maguire 
and a journalist seriously sat down to type up this article 🤦🏾‍♂️ harry maguire has had a shxt season but it doesn't take rocket science to question why he kept being selected and whether he's fit to be captain this is just an english player protection agenda 
this piece won't change the fact that harry maguire is crap amp always was if he leaves the club it's going to be better for all parties involved 
harry maguire 😢 
mancunian pele harry maguire and for sympathy reasons u can take mctomminony also 
only harry maguire is there hope 
why are you comparing dave with harry he shouldn't come to your mind after the abysmal displays if maguire did like de gea and said so would have no problem stop posting these to incite abuses only 
harry maguire 
how did harry maguire miss out 😤😤😤😤🤪🤪🤪 
sou harry maguire 
i give harry maguire standing ovation for scoring more 
harry maguire 
harry maguire 
player name on the jersey harry maguire 🤣🤣 
you guys employed harry maguire and also your club takes our leftovers 
ah yes because ronaldo can make harry maguire not the worst cb of all time and ronaldo doesn't have the likes of mbappe and neymar finishing off his chances he's got bruno smoking chance after chance clearly you don't watch games 🤡 
and then they go on about how harry maguire is shit well you are not playing pro football aren't you haha 
there's only one goat harry maguire 
harry maguire 
harry maguire has put a smile on sooooo many peoples faces it has to be him 
harry maguire 
need to investigate and ban accounts that keep buying the same player 🤬 easy example to find the culprits check every harry maguire purchase that started at 1000 coins but magically always sold for 3500 coins givenuptryingtobuyhim fifa22 
anyone who's not victor lindelof or harry maguire tbh 
the players you can have is harry maguire and scott and aaron wan bissaka bruno ain't for sale or de gea or ronaldo 
anthony elanga 6 10 probably rangnick's biggest stamp on this team good work ethic and a great athlete but really lacks the quality to make it long term at united in my opinion 
anthony elanga is not even championship quality almost true for most of the squad as well though depressing 
could i interest you in a young and up and coming attacker by the name of anthony elanga and we will throw mctominay and fred on the side just because it's such a pleasure doing business with you if you would like to kindly send over kimmich gravenberch and mazraoui 
now do you guys see why i said fuck edinson cavani 
your tweet was quoted in an article by metro 
according to fans marcus rashford edinson cavani paul pogba wan bissaka luke shaw jesse lingard and harry maguire did not perform for manager ok but didn't we had a big squad not taking mg11 to consideration don't we have one of the best academies in europe 2 n 
a hip flexor injury keeps the portugal striker out of today's game at selhurst park but in his place comes edinson cavani who is expected to leave the club but who is more than capable of providing panache when ronaldo is missing 
58 games 19 goals and seven assist in a manchester united shirt for edinson cavani we signed him 10 years too late nevertheless thanks for the memories 🎶give it give it give it to edi cavani🎶 cavani crymun ggmu mufc epl 🔵⚽️ 
edinson cavani's first premier league start since february 👍 
hannibal mejbri's full debut for united is overdue that instantly makes today's game a little more exciting edinson cavani's selection seems to be out of necessity mufc crymun 
mbappe is not even better than prime edinson cavani luis suarez or sergio aguero 
epl free agents jonjoe kenny  everton edinson cavani  man utd nicolas n'koulou  watford ben mee  burnley andriy yarmolenko  west ham juan mata  man utd joao moutinho wolves loris karius  liverpool danny welbeck  brighton fabian delph  everton angelo ogbonna  westham 
juan mata stop playing 
oh shut up you've probably never been to a game in your life manchester united has standards does juan mata also disgust you then because he was saying the exactly same i was saying go support arsenal if you want to tell people how to be fans 
as a proud manchester united season it was shite i swear most of united players were just there for the pay cheque respects to juan mata was the only one who behaved with dignity and respected us as the fans throughout the years 
one ov the few that gave his all when he was on the pitch good luck juan mata in wot u do nxt 👍 
i'll always say this juan mata is the player that made me fall in love with football and united 
juan mata should be sold to real sociedad 
thank you juan mata 
let bruno fernandes go let him go juan mata is far far better than this useless bruno fernandes 
made guaita pull off a decent save from outside the box scrapped with zaha got a yellow then rangnazi called him back for juan fucking mata at the 60th minute mark 
he was watching games from russia and was like yea juan mata will fix this 
bruno is not a proper number 10 he is a poor passer can't hold the ball gets easily frustrated… he needs to go get a younger version of juan mata 
we were saying during the game united were chasing the game and brought on juan mata and 2 random kids out of the academy 🤣 they're actually washed 
juan mata has played well even on way out 
just wait for ricky to see this u already know what he's gonna say everyday of the week i'm telling ya juan mata juan mata will control it and give a good pass😂😂😂 
rangnick continued to play jesse lingard juan mata despite having hannibal and garnacho on the bench neither the players showed any intent nor the interim manager 3 n 
13 juan mata again never really used until last couple games…maybe should have been used more then he was n a 
juan mata had 19 goals and 35 assists how is this only 36 💀 
correction we accidentally typed in '08' twice let's put that right substitution 62' manchester united off 46 hannibal mejbri on 08 juan mata 
you did luv hannibal and juan mata ball 🔥 at least you can have a cute vacation in portugal now tho 🥰 
just sell the players when they coached david moyes and jose mourinho namely matic juan mata phil jones ragnickout jonesout juanmataout epl mufc manunited manchesterunited 
not a chelsea fan but i believe juan mata should be mentioned 
juan mata on ralf is insert random curse word 
he's wondering why juan mata is not on the pitch🤔 
and juan mata replaces him unsure of that one by ralf rangnick who has 27 minutes left as the interim manager 
juan mata is a contender too 
my favorite part was juan mata on the bench recreating bruno's pass into ward's crotch using his fingers as stick figures 
juan mata at walking pace is still a better playmaker than your entire midfield 
and to think that juan mata started only 2 games is unbelievable 
juan mata covered in warm custard i ll get my coat 
you forgot juan mata 
juan mata came as one of the best players in the prem and somehow didn't get much of his wage cut over the years 
🇪🇸 juan mata's vision on manchester united and the past season via mufc 🔴 manutd 
i'd keep juan mata and rather get rid of alex telles juan mata is always a great plan b 
our most painful moment came from set piece when terry slipped while taking his penalty the most cherished moment came from juan mata set piece remember drogbaaaa… but when mason does it set piece becomes over rated tt recently spoke about no who ever gives him starts 
epl free agents jonjoe kenny  everton edinson cavani  man utd nicolas n'koulou  watford ben mee  burnley andriy yarmolenko  west ham juan mata  man utd joao moutinho wolves loris karius  liverpool danny welbeck  brighton fabian delph  everton angelo ogbonna  westham 
juan mata and dean hendersons wages are outrageous 
it's time to leave juan mata 
caleb from behind keyboard whom nobody knows surely knows better than juan mata 🤣🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ 
if the standard you're using is that of juan mata or lo celso then it was a good season for him it is nowhere near a goat season 
say it louder please i always say his legacy would've topped out at juan mata had he not had some of the greatest prem players of all time around him 
🇪🇸🗣️ juan mata on conversation with erik ten hag via i will see when we speak how we feel what his ideas are after that a decision will be made mufc 🔴 manutd 
🇪🇸🗣️ juan mata via bruno fernandes is football sick sometimes i tell him you're too heavy shut up ' with bruno i speak a lot about football he knows a lot of players he knows everything kind of like ander herrera was mufc 🔴 manutd 
🇪🇸🗣️ juan mata i've heard he's very methodical in the way he approaches games wants to win but in a certain way i just hope from inside of me whether or not i'm here he can implement that be true to himself and win trophies with this great club mufc 🔴 manutd 
🇪🇸🗣️ juan mata via this club needs first class individuals for each department that is how i understand mufc this club should be top of the class on pitch or off that's the only way i see this club competing for the biggest trophies manutd 🔴 
🇪🇸🗣️ juan mata certain standards were not met whether that's attitude level of training off the pitch which doesn't include players i think we all agree if we are completely honest and speak with certain people at the club we haven't been good enough mufc 🔴 
🇪🇸🗣️ juan mata via we need a reset in the culture of the club that's how i feel the standards what it means to represent this club to any player what entitles you to play for manchester united mufc 🔴 manutd 
you know funny thing is that before united got juan mata chelsea fans always kept flirting with the idea of mata playing with rooney they thought rooney would sign for the blues 
maguire and martial should be on the list and i still have faith on juan mata 
no way rashford will be playing over juan mata and also no way fred is playing over matic because when fred came on at halftime it was 1 0 and at the end of the match it ended 4 0 so clearly he was a big problem 
your tweet was quoted in an article by sportskeeda 
it's really very simple i want ten hag to have primary control of incomings and outgoings rather than arnold etc at time same time i'm allowed to have an opinion on juan mata and either way it doesn't affect reality 😅 hopefully that's basic enough for you to understand 😁 
premier league crystal palace vs manchester united substitution manchester united 74' off 17 fred on 47 shola shoretire

wesley fofana c 80millions les gars 
was at the same level as wesley fofana in saint etienne's academy even better according to some fans of the club watch fofana now an incredible level one of the best young players in the prem saliba's evolution wouldn't be different

i say this but rodgers has deserved the right to stay don't see who leicester attract just pretend 2021 22 was a write off vestergaard tax or something still a talented squad even post jamie vardy expect a lot more consistency 
yeah i thought that he was giving it back to us as he was speaking to redmond i think it was but not to sure what went on jamie vardy just tries to make us forget that his wife is a grass 
ye a poundshop jamie vardy 
missed out on schmeichel actually signalling he was giving it back to us basically jamie vardy being jamie vardy 
13 non penalty goals in 37 games does look washed to me but maybe you see it differently🤷‍♂️ kane also has played 1 500 more minutes than jamie vardy with 2 less non penalty goals👍 make of that what you will

not leicester not leicester not leicester not leicester and r i p jamie vardy's ucl dreams 
leicester need only jamie vardy 
i love jamie vardy 
what's your feelings on jamie vardy starting today 
jamie vardy is 35 and is still one of the best around ronaldo 37 but it's probably unfair to compare any players to him 
jamie vardy that police man 
mrs vardy being described as an unreliable witness is the courts polite way of saying f g liar she has made herself look an absolute idiot who will be shunned by all jamie will find that his fellow players will not interact with him as well 
he also said ricardo came on for pereira earlier rubbish source 
istg i love it ricardo pereira is one funny mf😭 
kinda like ricardo pereira if he didn't know how to defend and was left footed

that's not important if you are talking about grooming then iwobi leo troost ademola lookman maduka etc must and should not play for nigeria grooming isn't important before you play for nt 
it was unreal business i agree but we should've upgraded and we managed to spend barely any of it and on a downgrade should've spent it all on a better option than jan and stephens 
jack stephens saintsfc pocketed bruno fernandes but aside from that not great he's 28 now and hasn't progressed to the defender we thought he would be in 2017 shame as i do like him but we need better 100 4 10 
defenders won't leave jack stephens lyanco tino livramento romain perraud kyle walker peters unlikely to leave mohammed salisu likely to leave jan bednarek saintsfc 
i think the haskell is gonna depend on jack christopher if he wins the woody stephens i think chad will send him to nj to see if he can get the two turns but it wouldn't surprise me if ev was in nj either 
salisu mohammed will handle him😀😂 
defenders won't leave jack stephens lyanco tino livramento romain perraud kyle walker peters unlikely to leave mohammed salisu likely to leave jan bednarek saintsfc 
mohammed salisu has taken the most throw ins so he should get it 🙄 
you do know their defence plays better without him 
oriol romeu saintsfc not his best season imo but he's not been awful scored a belter against norwich but missed two free headers against burnley needed to score i'd still keep him here next season though as he still had good games this season 6 10 
we need to recharge and see what happens oriol romeu speaking to 🔊 
leicester schmeichel fofana evans castagne mendy justin maddison tielemans dewsbury vardy barnes southampton mccarthy walker lyanco stephens salisu redmond elyounoussi ward prowse oriol romeu armstrong adam armstrong 🏟️ king power stadium 
midfielders won't leave ibrahima diallo stuart armstrong will smallbone unlikely to leave james ward prowse 50 50 oriol romeu likely to leave nathan redmond saintsfc 
there was literally nothing between mbappe and la liga normal transfer talk imagine serie a complaining against southampton or something because they renewed oriol romeu and udinese were in talks with him 
nathan redmond best player itw 
you're finished not even better than nathan redmond in my books 
nathan redmond saintsfc not redmond's biggest fan and never have been another mediocre season from redmond only 1 league goal which took a deflection and is nowhere near good enough for this league sell 4 10 
ego of ronaldo and the ability of nathan redmond 
too right the squad are dog shit i'd keep forster but he's off tino kwp salisu jwp or sa che adam will smallbone adam armstrong and nathan redmond the rest can go 
such a great player making fernandez look like nathan redmond 
midfielders won't leave ibrahima diallo stuart armstrong will smallbone unlikely to leave james ward prowse 50 50 oriol romeu likely to leave nathan redmond saintsfc 
you had to find a way to chip in the hazard is better rhetoric eh hazard be who he go win you cl he then nathan redmond dukadaya 
nathan redmond 
bring back adam armstrong not a marquee signing but be bringing him home amp i think that would work wonders for him amp for us 
adam armstrong saintsfc not the season he would have wanted but was not really given much of an opportunity scored a great goal on his debut and a beauty against villa hopefully he'll get better next season although only 2 goals this season 4 10 
think adam armstrong deserves a chance obviously has a few confidence issues but with a decent man manager played in the right system with che i think he'd be lethal a decent manager would get him firing 
similar but would also keep perraud adams amp still think adam armstrong would be ok with a run in team ralph seemed to destroy his confidence 
adam armstrong went off with a head injury i believe 
adam armstrong went off with concussion both teams used 4 subs 
too right the squad are dog shit i'd keep forster but he's off tino kwp salisu jwp or sa che adam will smallbone adam armstrong and nathan redmond the rest can go 
that was stuart armstrong not adam i wouldn't sell stu as although he's been disappointing this season he's consistently been one of our best players since he joined 
what is the point of putting adam armstrong up front on his own ralph you don't know what you're doing mate 
leicester schmeichel fofana evans castagne mendy justin maddison tielemans dewsbury vardy barnes southampton mccarthy walker lyanco stephens salisu redmond elyounoussi ward prowse oriol romeu armstrong adam armstrong 🏟️ king power stadium

adam armstrong 
baffling adam armstrong is our worst striker by distance maybe his last chance before he gets sold o the summer 
you mean starting adam armstrong 
adam armstrong …yay goals goals goals 🙄 
adam armstrong starting 
adam armstrong as a lone striker 😳 playing for a 0 0 today then 
next season we're gonna be playing armstrong and adam's up front why not fucking get them playing already fucking mental 
adam armstrong up top 😍😍 
update broja misses out today's game so adam armstrong comes in 
adam armstrong urgh 
adam armstrong hat trick 
elyounoussi adam armstrong jwp vs wolves spurs a winner at spurs jwp kwp 
most improved moi elyounoussi most disappointing adam armstrong still think he can cut it best goal che vs watford best moment comeback vs spurs player of the season kwp favourite romain perraud 
all of them except ward prowse and che adams 
che adams 
but it's ok for us to play scott mctominay che adams and lyndon dykes he played for ireland since he was 14 
che adams saintsfc will never forget his winning goal against spuds that aside he's been average and very inconsistent wouldn't be too fussed if he stays or goes personally he's been decent when called upon though and his goal against watford was pretty good too 6 10 
i think there's a player in che adams aswell but southampton would want silly money for him 
that's why che adams plays for southampton and not a side pushing for top 6 
you've never heard of a winger or striker who creates think che adams 
attackers won't leave che adams unlikely to leave nathan tella mohamed elyounoussi likely to leave adam armstrong certain to leave armando broja loan shane long theo walcott moussa djenepo saintsfc 
i am baffled by the exclusion of che adams yes he isn't prolific but he is our best forward by a fair distance 
che adams must be banging ralph's wife clearly the most effective forward we have yet can't even get a look in 
tnx i was thinking same tbh maybe long for end and che adams doubt he will be benched for last 2 he had solid season i guess 
keep football out of politics as ibrahima konate controversially shows solidarity with palestine would be the headline in the daily mail 
started the season by welcoming our centerbacks who were injured throughout the whole of last season vvd gomez and matip with the addition of ibrahima konate the best young cb in the world who's been decent and yet to lose a game in a liverpool shirt 
did naby keita beat those assault allegations a couple years ago 
no room for l g b•t no champions for lg bt allohuakbar i'am mosleem same as sadio mane naby keita dan ibrahim konate 
fabi will be alright but doubt he'll last 90 thiago is 100 out so that means ive gotta deal with naby keita 🫠 
base on our form today and how we started do you think we have a chance at beating real madrid with naby keïta in midfield 
you ankasa you watch am aa he dey ball pass naby keita 
we need another midfielder like thiago naby keita cant do anything no tru pass killer ball he just doing gini short passing shaqiri passing is better than him 
people can only defend 60m generational midfielder naby keita by comparing him to 36 year old james milner 
naby keita not so much under the radar but very underrated for how much he's come in and improved his game with no injuries 
keita said we haven't seen anything yet and tbh i've seen plenty sell naby and oxlade and get bowen and trossard 
keita is so average and lazy no doubt mr hardwork milner i swear he provides liverpool with more opportunities at the field than naby who is so sloppy and slow also he barely helps on defense which milner does quite well 
hendo keita fab not sure if that'll be enough can already see naby walking off 10 mins into the match milner then may even skew our plans for the remainder of the match 
bobby has had better cameos but no reason to single this one out as a we won anyways and b naby stunk up anfield way more today keita really has failed to shine far too many times 
one guy can change it all naby keita 
roll on naby keita henderson fabinho midfield in champions league final next week 
don't forget we have an on form naby keita they have nothing against that in all seriousness though their right hand side of defence equals it out at least 
naby keita shouldve had at least 2 reds this season also var helped yous in the finals vs chelsea 
klopp subbing off keita to go full milderson with a front 4 is reckless but we have to take risks naby one of the few out there looking calm in possession 15 mins to win it 
premier league liverpool vs wolverhampton wanderers substitution liverpool 70' off 08 naby keïta on 09 roberto firmino 
very attacking sub for liverpool as naby keita is off for roberto firmino they've got no more subs livwol 
naby keita as well the ball bounces so much off his feet here 
id rather thiago with one leg than a fully fit naby keita 
even worse naby keita😔 
good but naby keita is absolutely pathetic 
naby keita is not real bro he's literally not even trying to defend or score useless guy 
he got in behind naby keita once and got on the end of konate's horror show error trent is the only rb held to these standards 🤣 
that's why people should use eyes and not stats naby keita elite 😭 
so he thinks you're naby keita 
and their very english captain jordan henderson 
i'll feel even closer to jordan henderson's biceps😳 
yes great player better than rodri and fernandinho and jordan henderson let us see what newcastle will be up to next season 
i don't usually advocate for a goalkeeper to be captain but if we're going to make a change i think the one player who has the respect of all of his teammates will continue the good work tyrone's done in the community is emi martinez unless sg signs jordan henderson instead 😝 
jack grealish champion of england premier league jordan henderson future champion of europe champions league 🥰🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 
i can't wait for west ham to sucker a team into spending 80 million on a b tec jordan henderson 
he's not as good as jordan henderson as he's playing in an elite european final hunlogic 
so u know jordan henderson 
how about jordan henderson the clown playing football instead of talking 
not as good as jordan henderson as he's playing in an elite european final 😂😂 
jordan henderson is bigger liverpool legend than gerrard in my book 
nhl patrick roy montreal canadiens nfl tom brady new england patriots nba micheal jordan chicago bulls mlb ricky henderson cfl micheal pinball clemons no one for soccer i don't follow or watch it 
my brother in christ do you want a team captained by jordan henderson to be seen as arguably the greatest team in pl history sort it out 
capt jordan henderson 
beckhan world class ffs he was jordan henderson with nicer hair 
gerrard just doesn't want people thinking jordan henderson is better than him can't blame him 
henderson younger and a higher ceiling than pope 
you can had some when jordan henderson lift the trophy 💀💀 
jordan henderson mate something about him is so triggering 
in the same way jordan cheerleader henderson won it 
but there's players like mbappe who play for money and nothing else and players like jordan henderson that play for the love of the game mbappe was never going to move to real 
we have lowered these personal glory to only goals goals n assists i think it's time to recognize players like jordan henderson micheal carrick de bruyne fabinho fernandinho etc players that play different positions for the good of the team kevin de bruyne deserved it 
don't jordan my henderson 
i remember feeling like this when jordan henderson was poty 
i remember feeling like this when jordan henderson was poty 
they are not fair year in and year out it's a fact you win the league you collect everything the same way jordan henderson won it the year liverpool won't it 🤷🏽‍♂️ 
homeboy literally has 2 assists more than jordan henderson but he is the poty 😂 i'm not mad though he's been quality but yaaaaaaa man 
jordan henderson is a great example of this fantastic player who does all the fundamentals brilliantly but isn't rated by rival fans as he rarely does the spectacular 
same line of overrated players like wilshere this guy was supposed to win ballon d'or acc to english media jordan henderson dele alli etc all trash 
recency bias lad everyone just forgetting kdb was desperate until december january he has 2 more assists than jordan henderson😂💩 
by that logic is jordan henderson the creative type 
he'll sit for diogo jota 
diogo jota 32 points as cap vs leicester salah 84 on triple cap 
if liverpool win the premier league they will pay a huge bonus to wolves as part of d diogo jota transfer man city wins too de will pay 15million bonus to aston villa as part on grealish deal city scored 3 goals in 3 minutes the matches na script 
13 jarrod bowen 14 reece james 15 wilfried zaha 16 bruno fernandes 17 jose sa 18 ivan toney 19 marc cucurella 20 diogo jota 21 leandro trossard 22 raheem sterling 23 harry kane 24 james maddison 25 adama traore 
does that make park a better player than son by your logic hudson odoi is a better player than diogo jota because he has more trophies😂😂😂 
very excited to see him with 🇵🇹 next week probably the most in form player in the squad him over diogo jota at the moment in the pecking order 
pep can only win with the richest club in the league barca bayern city he'd never be able to take an andy robertson or diogo jota and make them world beaters 
liverpool make a substitution as mohamed salah is on for diogo jota can he lead his side to the premierleague title livwol wolves 
premier league liverpool vs wolverhampton wanderers substitution liverpool 58' off 20 diogo jota on 11 mohamed salah 
liverpool are still alive here diogo jota… miniminao 😭 
special mentions 🌟 diogo jota 385 pts james maddison 392 pts bernardo silva 385 pts all these guys were great much love ♥️ next season will be massive 💪 
that'll be for the deal of diogo jota yeah 
🚨 if liverpool win the premier league they will have to pay a huge bonus to wolves as part of the diogo jota transfer wolves play liverpool on the final day of the season 😏 but wait there is a clause which states that aston villa is supposed to receive £15 
i hope diogo jota is hooked for salah at half time the portuguese has been abysmal for months now 
if liverpool win they will pay wolves a bonus as part of the transfer of diogo jota livwol 
diogo jota own goal today🕯🕯🙏🏽😂😂😂 agent jota on the scene 
it should be an agreement game cos liverpool is to pay wolves for diogo jota why then should they drag stress liverpool they should sell the game with pride 
just for diogo jota score you win this bet very easy 
i thought i packed diogo jota iwl i was so confused when i saw portugal cf 😭😭 
oh the other hand wolves will supposedly get money if jota wins the league 
over to merseyside similarly liverpool have to pay wolves a bonus as part of diogo jota's transfer agreement liverpool play against wolves in a much needed win encounter at anfield quite an interesting tale to the end of this epl campaign livwol mciavl 
this is true we apparently built a clause into diogo jota's contract that pays us a hefty bonus if liverpool win the league today so i can't imagine we'll try too hard to win but i would love it so much 
diogo jota is just one game away and he will become a premier league champion for the first time and wolves fans will be there to see it in person 😅 
salah and mané will start for sure the third attacker is hard to tell but luis daiz is in better form than diogo jota so i'm guessing he will start 
for context wolves will be receiving a healthy bonus for the sales of diogo jota should lfc win the league 
big claims to be signings of the season had luis diaz come to tottenham as had looked likely until liverpool dived in for him then it might have been even more crazy finish but we probably wouldn't have got kulu had that happened 
couldn't tell if i was watching kerwin vargas or luis diaz 
city are not clinical enough with their chances liverpool might be the most clincial team in europe right now your defense sucks you will play toni kroos as a starter luis diaz vs carvajal 
the new luis diaz 
luis diaz is better than u my friend 
f a m i l y m o t h e r maria diaz f a t h e r luis ortegas s i b l i n g s lj ortegas younger brother c h i l d r e n none o t h e r unknown 
luis diaz obviously this season and in the same league bruno fernandes before that and luis suarez much before that just to name a few sunderland got promoted and your head is gone dougie just a flurry of stupid tweets 
luis diaz costs more than 15 mil 
fyi luis diaz is skinnier than pulisic so if he can survive here so can ampadu 
for me i will pick luis diaz ahead of him 
who be luis diaz ah 
kdb graham potter werner sterling everton west ham in liverpool a 3 golu luis diaz 
luis diaz did this and liverpool fans went crazy loool 
here are my season rewards pots heung min son ypots bukayo saka signing of the season luis diaz martin odegaard flop of the season nuno tavares 🗿 underrated transfer marc cucurella manger of the year eddie howe 
to push city to the final day while contesting the other three trophies is absolutely amazing luis diaz a revelation in 2022 konate brilliant until some errors today quite a team 
please be luis diaz 
stop talk shit grealish is ovrrated biggest flop this season if we look his price luis diaz did better season and he even began in january 
yes he could have passed the damn ball to luis diaz and other teammates im just saying 👋🏻 
luis diaz al liverpool 
naa luis diaz was the best transfer bruno second 
they did an article a few days ago where they got luis diaz to sign for united on football manager to see how he'd get on i don't think what i've done is unjustified 😭😭 
goalkeeper of the season de gea defender of the season thiago silva midfielder of the season kevin de bruyne striker of the season luis diaz coach of the season eddie howe flop of the season player christensen useless club of the season united and arsenal 
luis diaz would like a word 
i love absolutely everyone in that team but luis diaz for me he's been absolutely incredible with so little time to adapt to our play style looked like he's been here for years can't wait to see what he's gonna be like next season and in the future❤️❤️ 
rodrygo and luis diaz winner receives 2 and skill move upgrade 
5 star skills luis diaz 
idk when i'll get released but yeah showdown him vs luis diaz 
luis diaz as he didn't get a tots or tots moments and rodrygo since he took real madrid to extra time in both the quarter finals and semi finals 
rodrygo or mendy would be so cool for madrid maybe a fabinho or luis diaz one for liverpool 
ok but are u mad or just bad because luis diaz isnt champion at pl ahjjajasdkfaksfdkaskfdaskf 
mendy hazard fabinho luis diaz i guess it will be valverde or casemiro and diaz or robertson 
grealish and luis diaz 
could be luis diaz level i reckon 
liverpool luis diaz 
yes he should assist to luis diaz in that play he missed playing alone when city was 0 2 down and with that goal and that pressure of liverpool winning the city would have never scored those 3 goals 
how did sancho do after scoring amp assisting bucket loads in germany scoring loads in norway austria and germany means nothing werner germany top scorer can't hit the net here ye of little faith luis diaz gt haaland all day haaland has zero skill in build up play 
luis díaz is raw talent though it is incredible because it literally is pure talent what got him out of colombia at that age and straight into europe he's got a huge future assuming klopp and his team can polish out his rough edges which are really bad at times ik 
i'll tell you guys a funny story tottenham had agreed everything with luis diaz in january barca informs tottenham that dembele is for sale they delay diaz signing to negotiate with dembele liverpool steps in and signs diaz covers gap with city from 14 points to 1 
mané had lost his 1 v 1 ability and firmino was a lot worse than people thought no surprise luis diaz comes in someone who's not even a superstar and we go on a run i don't know how we even won in 19 20 despite making no signings 
what a stupid comment that's what tyler does it's his job to build things up 
player of the season salah young player of the season saka signing of the season luis diaz flop of the season sancho goal of the season maybe rodri vs watford most improved player of the season martinelli 
until we signed luis diaz in january we barely had any cover and thank god we signed him without whom none of the cups or the title run in would have been possible 
talking about peripheral european nations so maybe he's portuguese so i'll guess he was talking about luis diaz 
you never want to lose a championship but of all the ways to lose that was the most thrilling way to do it already excited for champions league final next week and then a full season with luis diaz begins again in august up the reds lfc ynwa 
player of the season de bruyne young player of the season foden best signinf of the season luis diaz worst signing of the season varane breakout player of the season kulusevski flop of the season sancho manager of the season pep guardiola 
not only that but the energy in the stadium for that would be higher 
or maybe he's just more excited for the gundogan goal because it completes a 3 2 comeback to win the league 
that was his point 
come back when you've caught luis diaz up in trophies won lad diaz on 2 in 4 months how many you got in your career upto now pigeon s r 😎😎😎😎😎🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼 
warra premier league for both luis diaz and chelsea this season 
not as finished as chelsea and luis diaz are 
definitely tiago amp luis diaz are major threats but he's out injured with a hamstring luis diaz will be well taken care of by carvajal amp fede valverde 
son then luis diaz 
maybe if he squared the ball to luis diaz in the spurs game he would look a lot more happier 
but if villa had defended better liverpool would be better than city 😂😂 luis diaz will be gutted to hear he hasn't improved liverpool either 
ya melt enjoy your we avoided relegation party that's all you'll have to celebrate… luis díaz has been a red for 4 months and won more than you lot have in 27 years 😂 
he asked for luis diaz to start with 
luis diaz and kulusevski dicked on him in half a season 
luis díaz has been a red for 4 months and won more trophies than you have in 27 years 
luis diaz can still win the quadruple 
it's possible but can't see it either i had similar hopes about luis diaz but he's been incredible 
what did liverpool need that luis díaz arrived a couple of months earlier 🙌💪❤️ 
what a premier medal for luis diaz 
what did liverpool need that luis díaz arrived a couple of months earlier 💪💪💪💪💪❤️❤️ 
so what martin tyler is a city fan 
he could've passed to luis diaz during the tottenham game p 
luis diaz not winning the premier league feasting 
i have the tendency to support any team that have a colombian as a player really i don't feel that much affiliation for the team but i'm very found of luis diaz 
add luis diaz and jota to the list 
better than luis diaz 
at the end they won… now luis diaz … sorry liverpool will have the champions to win it will be a hard match 
nah our fanbase wants big name not actual ballers like son luis diaz 
few reports emerged that ralf had asked the club to sign vlahovic luis diaz and alvarez lets dive into it vlahovic never wanted to leave to italy whereas alvarez was scouted by city for two years diaz was chased by west ham but could not get the deal over the line 7 n 
luis diaz still a flop player livarpool still have a 1pl in 20 years 
if i were the owner of liverpool i would trade mane luis diaz and salah for u 
luis diaz definitely had a shot on target today 
the honeymoon period supporters gave luis diaz should be officially over he can't keep winning motm by showing nice skills but making wrong decisions mo selfish ass almost cost of the game but he is good for it so he gets a pass onto 2022 2023 season 
last point was so important for me… gw 28 wasn't brave enough to start cash with a dgw over cancelo with a sgw… the outcome 28 points gw 33 went for luis díaz on gw31 wc and benched him to start kulu bha when i was sure he would be the diff i needed outcome 12 pt 
well fair play to wolves they pushed us that was a tough game man c 3 goals in 5 min ducked us up 
do not forgot liverpool squad is 900 million and var decisions all favour for liverpool luis diaz is biggest impact for liverpool in second half of season 
how did luis diaz not have a shot on target 
pipe down luis diaz has won more trophies in 5 months than your shite have won in 30 years 
only league to have 9 0 scores almost every season 🤣 not to mention city wins every game like 4 0 and the so called hardest league gets dogged by new players every season example bruno luis diaz ruben dias kulusevski auba and salah when they rejoined de bruyne 
how it's a title deciding goal lmao what do you expect 
the players were incredible despite all the heat generated between mo and mane after afcon luis diaz is a dream signing and big divock leaves 
what is a luis diaz 
it was the draws in the end that did us but can't fault the team it's been an incredible season had we signed luis diaz in the summer the league would've definitely been ours 
we paid 60mil for ferran leeds will ask for something similar or a bit lower like luis diaz deal we don't know yet 
congrats 
he literally done it to mock carragher who's the most biased commentator on sky 
luis díaz should be left wing playing in the sideline that's his game 
was he even the best winger of this january window i'd argue luis diaz had a way bigger impact via being one of the key players for a literal quadruple charge 
5 goals 8 assists in 15 games and firing us to the ucl suck your luis díaz signing of the season agenda 
i mean luis diaz has been pretty good 
luis diaz maybe 
they're probably hoping they won't get sued by saying it's a satire or parody somewhere however that has not been a successful strategy for others 
luis diaz is better apparently 
until luis diaz wins liverpool the league in 2023 
nah he would be overshadowed by luis diaz and his gang he'd be cleaning their boots if he went to liverpool 
eddie dropped 100 bodies on bobby edmundo luis miguel diaz estoy avergonzada not his real middle name but it felt right 
top pickup 🔝 luis diaz i've been a big fan of luisito for a while i had the first waiver in january when he signed so he was an obvious pickup for me the colombian was incredible in his 11 starts 13 apps averaging about 12 ppg more importantly he was a joy to watch 
yep man's a predator when he's in form great awareness in the area trouble is he's not been in those spaces enough luis diaz running round like a madman trying to instigate things whereas diogo looks lost 
what we will hear is it's luis diaz 
praying we score another goal now😭 luis diaz for the premier league winner goal i'd probably cry😂😂 
luisdiaz luis díaz should play left wing as in the porto 
luis diaz is the one that makes me the most nervous carvajal has his work cut out 
cancelo and luis diaz i call you for the last time this season 🙏 step up boys help he get back to the top three 
couldn't tell u 
fire stick vpn 
be a fire stick mate 
thiago and luis diaz…boss 
what program is that 
idk man if militao turns up we're good i'm just afraid of luis diaz against carvajal salah will be in mendy pockets mane doesn't scare me mans losing his pace 
this isn't luis diaz 
i sold havertz for luis diaz 🤣😣😣😣 
i'm switching between games tbh luis diaz mane and taa might cause a few problems 
clear of luis diaz😍 
if luis diaz is going to continue to be liverpools only creative playmaker they are going to lose this came and the ucl final big chances gotta come from someone else man 
luis diaz will be history in the final i declare it from now on you will remember me i just hope to have an autographed shirt from the whole team blessing liverpool 🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴 
everyday we're luis diaz and inshallah 
you're not ready cause luis diaz will just keep missing his chances

naa are you really asking this luis diaz is even clear of pulisic 
imo salah should've got a break post afcon the guy lost a final after carrying alongside the goalkeeper and he was playing like the best player itw before then klopp should've given him a full week 2 week break as we were coping without him and we signed luis diaz then as well

as players they would want to be in the cl as soon as they sign vlahovic achieved his goal by moving to juve luis diaz achieved it at liverpool and pulisic got it at chelsea no one will think oh i will help arsenal for 1 or 2 years they want it now 
one last nugget of wisdom for me ash do i play safe with the eo or go for it with my cap choice options of son kane mount luis diaz i'm 3rd in my ml by about 15 points no chance of 1st 🌍 25 4k

luis díaz 🔴 the columbian only joined liverpool in january but he has already made a huge impact finding his place in the starting 11 62 points and 7 g a in only 12 games shows the talent he has due to salah's injury he looks set to start against wolves in gw38 
pencelo not clear of scotlands captain 
luis diaz best january signing ever 
hey guys would you take a 4 for coutinho richarlison out luis diaz random fwd in or just coutinho out madders in 🤔 
mental isn't it yet your manager sits there talking about how everyone loves us yet foden and kdb get the awards they nowhere near deserve weird bloke you got there 
i'm doing coutinho to luis diaz or maddison any suggestions on who i should go with 
contemplating a 4 of kdb and jesus to luis diaz and kane unless i hear vardy starts … if u had both the spurs boys would u captain kane 
in my mini league the guy above me has luis diaz and he's 30 points ahead the guy 10 points behind me has mount shall i get mount or diaz can't get both…i'm planning to capt kdb who the guy above me doesn't have to make up the 30 help 
he literally was nominated for poty meanwhile robbo is still fighting the davies comparisons behave yourself 😭 
🔴what would the data analysts be able to do ▶️replacing a star player coutinho wanted to leave so they upgraded with luis diaz amp depending on salah amp mane ▶️ knowing the other and adapting the self reading the opponents tactics and adapting to the opponents weaknesses 
in my mini league the guy above me has luis diaz and he's 30 points ahead the guy 10 points behind me has mount shall i get mount or diaz can't get both…i'm planning to capt kdb who the guy above me doesn't have to make up the 30 help

i'm in a similar position mate personally thinking cash to sess and coutinho to luis diaz or jota 
i'll have a luis diaz shirt cause we are gonna win 🤞 
liverpool luis diaz 
luis diaz once it is possible 
anyone other than luis diaz is wrong 
stats can be made to whatever you want it to be you would expect a forward to have better stats here kdb totally deserves it salah has dropped in form since luis diaz arrived 
raphinha 25 leeds united idk why any madridista or even any team even mention him he's so good and hasn't even hit his prime yet he's the rw equivalent of luis diaz 
tbf they did sign luis diaz 
you can get luis diaz for 38 million he'd run through a brick wall for you and if your auntie was sick he'd pop round and cheer her up 
and chambers 
all players have really stepped up to a top gear this season the addition of luis diaz in january changed the complexion of the club one of the signings that excited fans much before the signings was done it created a huge fanfare btw club and the fans 
in my opinion he's a good footballer and worths 45 50m pounds he played quite well and carried aston villa at that time his price should be around luis diaz's 
the nervous water drinking 😂😂 i honestly have no belief that city will drop points… but somewhere in there the hope is ready to kill 
decent i would have put luis diaz instead of mane and maybe kulusevski instead of mount but the rest of that side is solid 
i have 8 1m in the bank if i sell zaha how about zaha gt luis diaz for a 4 hit 🤔 can't convince myself for the hit don't see much upside diaz ceiling is not very high and can get subbed off based on city game 
what are the luis diaz goal odds please there is nothing showing 
i would like a luis díaz shirt 
changes done richarlison to toney michael keane to sessengon amp zaha to luis diaz the goat 
lewis transferred in schmeichel earning 8 points alonso earning 7 points de bruyne earning 30 points mount earning 13 points maddison earning 8 points luis díaz earning 15 points dennis earning 2 points jesus earning 2 points 85 points in 
congratulations new uefa world champions 2022 lucho luis diaz 1 
strong daniel levy reporting liverpool to liverpool for signing luis diaz vibes 
surely it's up there with daniel levy reporting liverpool's transfer team to liverpool for signing luis diaz 
trying to remain positive come on stevie 
will they🤨 
nope i think first 10mins 
happy birthday bro🤟 
thanks mate got some light now 😂 btw who's the best transfer between these two a luis diaz and kane b mane and toney 
the same milan that's top of serie a on final day of season yep that shows you how good the group is vs lfc quad chasers porto w luis diaz amp athletico spanish champs might be a surprise but someone has to finish bottom genius 😂🤣 brugge or leipzig would've added 0 quality 
who do you think is on penalty duties now for liv if salah doesnt play is it mane milner and fabinho dont appear in any predicted lineup if he isnt i see and upside to go for luis diaz 
🙏🏼 luis diaz pretty please 
we thought it was luis diaz but it was deki 🤩 
instead of neymar lets sign three good quality players last year so many wanted lukaku and look where we ended up we don't need expensive signings we just need talented players with grit like mane diaz diego costa mascherano luis suarez etc 
luis diaz hat trick 😉 
fpl gw38 transfers 8 gordon richarlison amp cash gt luis diaz toney amp sessegnon 🫡 son yet another season is almost in the books looks like it's going to be a close one whether or not i beat last years or 🤞 only trent and toney left from my gw1 team 😅 good luck ⚽️ 
luis diaz on mines please 😮‍💨💯🙏🏽 
salah and generational don't joke with that one you'd be better off calling luis diaz generational or even kdb 
brother 🍺 what's your name mate so i don't keep referring to you as my colombian luis diaz mate 🤣🤣 
luis diaz liverpool 😏

jose sa was on crack 
jose sa by far the best goalie in the league this season watch ederson alisson make toty though🥱 
hey what our your thoughts on jose sa if we sell henderson do you think we can get an elite gk 
fuckin dendoncker missing easy chances neto and jose sa getting injured the game was destined for liverpool to win it supporting an underdog team would be fun they said 🥲

buy maignan or jose sa 
we need jose sa 
colin well one out of 4 but i couldn't have foreseen how poor united's season would be son for me was the main winner of the golden boot salah wins playmaker deservedly varane had to many injuries jose sa or ronaldo for signing and i didn't foresee chelsea falling off 
hope josé sa is alright had a brilliant season player of the year 😎👌😎👌😎👌 
first half the better score a early goal neto got injury that was game over josé sa are two best players lucky liverpool thank god man city won fair play 2 0 down to villa win 3 2 brilliant result 😎💜😎💜😎💜 
yes wala ng bearing si ninoy aquino now that they have been exposed jose rizal international is much better pwede ring i revert sa mia 
sell errorsen this summer pls and buy jose sa 
pretty much have our date set after we switched out jose sa at half hopefully av can score in extra time… 
jose sa literally exists 
no jose sa is deffo injured im watchin that game rn 
jose sa is out for wolves we're done 
what the blazes happened to jose sa 
so scripted jose sa off bros 
maybe because jose sa needed treatment 💀 
jose sa scoring header to deny liverpool's title 🤩 
jose sa is injured 
wolves goalkeeper jose sa also appears injured he might be subbed off later john ruddy would be the man who would come on liverpool livwol 
also jose sa is down so probably johnnyy sins is coming to save liverpool 
jose sa please dont go 
i have a feeling that a lot of gaga's struggles right now are based on all the noise going on around him and as things are settled he will regain form that being said jose sa has been best gk in england this year so wolves would give him time to develop 
jose sa got a pre assist against pool and you're praising two standard saves 
jose sa tax luckiest footballer itw 
my oldest watched jose sa videos all the time he plays goalie too might have a new wolves fan 
does he do any work before the game called taa trent meanwhile jose sa is the goalkeeper

well this statistically isn't true as an all round keeper josé sá is also peaking 30 in a few months so improvement will be minimal 
jose sa is wayy bettah than him 
he's your captain he got auto subbed cuz he didn't play last week the surprising part is jose sa is your vice and he's out too 
your signing of the season jose sa flop of the season grealish underrated player of the season matty cash team of the season brentford manager of the season david moyes 
we were expected to concede sixteen more goals than we did jose sa is very very good only positive i can say really 
another one for the future can we not sign one for now for only £6 million… hang on we did jose sa 
even jose sa go catch am 
what do u think of jose sa 👀 
jose sa is good 
i loved him sm i even kept faith in him after 19 20 and the uel final💀 but the city 4 1 game was the end he'll always be a legend but time to get a keeper like jose sa 
do you understand what an opinion is lol if son is my opinion why does that hurt others your biased because your selecting what you want to see same for son no player has been clinical than he has in front of goal jose sa has been outstanding for wolves 
i've one free transfer and josé sa to someone is the best i can think of but 🤷 i don't know who's keeping a clean sheet i'd say i'm waiting for team leaks to see if i need to do something else 
let's say during the campaign season naging pinakamautak si risa over the whole pink yellow camp she never joined the party sa negative campaigning she never spoke ill of bbm or any of the uniteam candidates as fas as i can remember she knows whats happening

might also be goodbye to romain saiss and joão moutinho too it's going to be a proper fork in the road summer at molineux and i don't think i trust the club to pick the right options at the moment wwfc

i mean you're the one out here openly admitting that you and your whole family are constantly being turned down for jobs and that you complain a lot seems like the dude living in the glass house of failure shouldn't be throwing stones around 
the who who also performed still touring playing great songs after 58 years as a top act must be something about the 60 early 70's generations plus elton john rod stewart that made them as popular today as then not to forget the stones who are 60 amp counting from 1 6 22 
that was my greatest fear the english media they were waiting to tear him to shreds and mock him he didn't even help himself with that line up fernandinho was leaving i agree but he had no business starting that game when john stones was back cancelo at lb was a no no 
stones exists 
how has he managed to do that dias and stones carrying hard 
john stones dance please 
raas john stones really one of us 
you are better than harry maguire john stones tyron mings amp ben whites sadly you won't be picked by southgate because he doesn't rate congratulations pal much deserved 
he should automatically be first choice centerback for england with his performances this season him and john stones 
manlike john stones true yardie 
dier as well best english cb this season in the prem alongside john stones 
forest forest forest but john stones tho 😮‍💨 
remember when george bush leaked that john mccain had a black baby because he'd been unfaithful to his wife they adopted i always love how religious people forget that they shouldn't throw stones when they've sinned repeatedly 
make john stones dance again 
no because i don't think he is i've always liked him but there was a point this season i woke up and thought wow i love john stones not sure where it came from but yeah here we are 
me too i also have a strong albeit completely caught me unaware this season love for john stones 
please for next season john stones need really more than 83 please make it 
john stones 8 very disrespectful season our best defender when on form should have played more although when he did incroyable

john stones was loving it 
have you seen john stones i need that man 
oooooo my cousins john stones 
not if john stones scores an own goal😂 
john stones own goal will settle it you heard it here first 
he sometimes makes some unnecessary you have zinchenko you bench him and play cancelo at lb and fernandiho in cb while john stones the cb plays at rb who does this 😂😂 
yeah he said should've started john stones 
its a john stones thing for you innit zo 😅😅🙏stay cool 😎 girl 😅😅 
i beg we take ferna off move john stones centre and get walks on 
i'm wondering why walker is on the bench and john stones is at rb 
if laporte den john stones den walker all dey wey you go play fernandinho for there den he dey deserve am 
get john stones to cb and walker on fernandinho is a disaster waiting to happen again cancelo needs a slap 
pep o jesa ko left back john stones o dirang teng when he has a natural left back in zinchenko john is slow and indecisive rather play him centrally and take out fernandinho 
and how did they get ferran torres and ake and de bruyne john stones ederson laporte walker use your head and stop cherry picking logic 
john stones is right back 
erm pretty good but as per answer to john not nearly as good as my mum's black forest style trifle ooh i can taste it now my job was to remove the stones from the cherries 🍒 it was a lovely ritual 
john stones rb tho i thought he was a cb 
i said a quote from john lennon on let it bleed being stolen from let it be you said lennon made that claim not a general stones vs beatles quote i asked for one about the specific comparison we were talking about 
what about john stones😉🤦 
you asked about quotes from artist john lennon said the rolling stones ripped off the bestles rolling stones are their baby and they really are not on the same street as the beatles or day stevie wonder 
pep likes taking unnecessary chances i mean he's got kyle walker nathan akè and john stones fit but risks like this on the final day is madness 
we have john stones to cover at rb and cb 😆 
no because john stones is rb fernandinho will be cb in a back 3 in possession and back 4 with cancelo out of possession 
hmmm yes and no they said the same thing about john stones on his day he can be great but not quite sure the consistency is there at least not yet 
why starting fernandinho at the centre half amp john stones right back i hope he doesn't bottle it with his overthinking attitude we are fed up already 
but i'm at the etihad stadium where john stones comes in for manchester city kyle walker back on the bench robin olsen in goal for villa no emi martinez 
john stones 
john stones rb 
john stones 
john fucking stones 
on side note i almost had john stones instead of sessegnon and change my mind with seconds to go let's see how that plays out👀 
john stones and kyle walker are with the mancity squad vs aston villa via 
john lennon said it was a rip off and he knows better than you… again like the rolling stones if you want they are not an original group and regardless of muddy waters opinion they stole black american music really is simple and they were all drug addict pos 
hearing john stones and walker have also been training for city and according to ft klopp is benching salah today 
faire to go in french go go alkeeper is john stones the best goalkeeper in pl history 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱 
not everyone can have john stones bro its normal 
pep is going to start kyle walker and john stones 
agi is more capable than simple ai agi would be a fighter jet without a human winning a dog fight against a human flown plane it's also a john deere tractor harvesting a crop better than a human picker while removing stones and applying nutrients to soil 
before pep sterling never got more than 7 goals in a season john stones was considered a flop nobody had heard of phil foden kyle walker was benched by trippier and kevin de bruyne was a £60m flop do i need to go on 
in today's game so top of the league have had john stones at the back for 25 games and 2nd in the league have had matip at the back for 25 games and you're telling me that tony adams would struggle you play way too much fifa mate i suppose john terry would struggle to 
john stones 8 10 looked our best cb this season massively important to the way we play again it doesn't help he can't settle down with a partner 
unfortunately players will ultimately miss out on going to tournaments the life of a big time footballer involves fighting for places john stones will be fighting for his life next season with dias ake amp laporte konate will be fighting for his with matip and vvd 
what about this john 10 30 31 33 nkjv i and my father are one 31 then the jews took up stones again to stone him 33 the jews answered him saying for a good work we do not stone you but for blasphemy and because you being a man make yourself god he claim to b god 
crawford quote yes 😉 i love the fact that someone recognised the guy who was delivering the papers as someone who'd won the english league title you can't imagine that happening to andy robertson or john stones 
nathan ake john stones benjamin mendy walker cancelo would have been very expensive but man city added danilo as part of the deal laporte dias only defense is almost 280 million 
with your blessing i will drop the video of the failed attempt at the john stones dance on the burner acc 
john stones earns 250 000 weekly and joao cancelo 80 000 weekly 
john stones long range screamer… 
who said the earth is flat god created the world so i'm sure he knows the shape also what's your point of the manner in which the law was upheld 2000 years ago lol read john 8 7 and that'll answer your question about stones 
i've been depressed before john no shame i took antidepressants and did some therapy it helped do you have some other common medical conditions you like to heckle nice kidney stones hahaha i'm talking to a real ass troll genuine item 
the who won't get fooled again o rolling stones gimme shelter o elton john tiny dancer esas 
i still listen to my stones records they're great but now mick sounds like a frog and keith is too arthritic to form a chord and yet once you've been on stage and people clap there's no substitute so on they go 
congratulations aymeric you been fantastic all season 
what a season aymeric 💙💙💙💙 
deserve it aymeric you was incredible this season 
aymeric laporte 8 agenda aside very very good season with some insane tackles when he isn't getting bailed out by nathan ake 
great season aymeric 👏🏻 
aymeric laporte 7 10 again another average season been good and suspect at times i'd also like to add i think he takes the blame for stuff that's not even his fault 
on t'attend aymeric 
any news about bernardo silva leaving any approach from real madrid 
bernardo silva's volley against aston villa absolutely robbed 
lowering the standards even more with another 50m buy when did this guy get 10 goals a season and he's playing de bruyne and bernardo silva odegaard and xhaka will make sure he doesn't score more than 4 goals next season 
so you propose what exactly throw tons of money to everyone to make them feel appreciated make him earn more than salah son mahrez and bernardo silva 
i already forgot about fraudbappe and apart from tchouameni we should go for gnabry contract ends on 2023 and will be cheap 35m maybe bernardo silva and a rb 
if casemiro camavinga alaba and kross can play as defensive midfielder why we need tchouameni we got rudiger so alaba will not be only cb florian wirtz bellingham or bernardo silva are better options 
if casemiro camavinga alaba and kross can play as defensive midfielder why we need tchouameni we got rudiger so alaba will not be only cb florian wirtz bellingham or bernardo silva are better options 
goalkeeper of the season alisson defender of the season rudiger midfielder of the season bernardo silva striker of the season son coach of the season guardiola flop of the season player lakaka useless club of the season the almighty manure united 
i don't buy the gnabry story… even if it's true mahrez or bernardo silva would be miles clear 
have missed some absolute cracking goals from the goal of the season vote no bernardo silva v villa ward prowse free kick 
goal of the season and bernardo silva's goal against villa isn't on the list 😮🤦🏻‍♂️ 
bernardo silva vs villa away🤔 or what about jwp 35yard free kick 
bernardo silva's goal against villa wins goal of the season hands down criminal you left it out 😡 
how the hell is the bernardo silva goal away at villa but in the goal of the season list utter dogshit selection from motd 
i'm following cristiano since 2005 imo the nations leafue is bigger than the wc because ronaldo won it the wc is tinpot farmer's cup only for superteams ronaldo can't carry such finisged players as ruben dias bernardo silva and joao cancelo 
how on earth is bernardo silva volly not in that list beats everyone of them goals 
how is bernardo silva's volley vs villa not in the goal of the season contenders list 
i wish for tchouameni bernardo silva who is versatile and can even transition later to cm and a solid rb obviously the dream is hakimi but he is in prison my personal wish is malo gusto but it won't happened 
gnabry bernardo silva mahrez and salah over him whichever among these madrid can get their hands on 
defo we need a gundogan bernardo silva type a needle player who can arrive in the box also 
goalkeeper of the season allison defender of the season cancelo midfielder of the season bernardo silva striker of the season son coach of the season eddie howe flop of the season player lukaku useless club of the season man utd 🥲 
and bernardo silva mahrez too you can't complain about this😭 
that's why i want a player like bernardo silva or foden or mount to balance our midfield 
goalkeeper of the season ramsdel defender of the season matip midfielder of the season bernardo silva striker of the season cr7 coach of the season conte flop of the season player sancho useless club of the season man u

mine 👇 goalkeeper of the season allison defender of the season rudiger midfielder of the season bernardo silva striker of the season son coach of the season conte flop of the season player grealish useless club of the season man utd 
i'm made up to be honest just need bernardo silva to block me now for a perfect day 
signings that can make us ucl challengers next season lewandowski raphinha antony koulibaly kounde bernardo silva incase f dejong leaves 
coman would be solid i agree bernardo silva or leao would be interesting too 😀 
bernardo silva playing golf rn 
you don't need as a midfielder he's got enough to beat his man over 5 meters just needs to be braver and stronger on the ball in games that matter he's like gundogan bernardo silva etc not fast just super smart and can turn quickly and create passing angles at will 
yeah but without the oil money mate you would still have stephen ireland in centre mid that letter that bernardo silva sent you is pretty sick though to be fair class that 
this is really a high price he's worth 60m at best we can get bernardo silva for 70m 
bernardo silva should take note this is what sportsmanship amp respect is about anyway he should have a soft pot for liverpool because my 2 grandsons say he works in the quarter in liverpool spit 
can modric or bernardo silva run from opponents we don't need him to do that 
get him asap then try to bring gnabry nkunku darwin pedro porro give a thought on bernardo silva would be great addition to our ageing midfield 
foden the only one who dribbled through the villa three times in the first half and had his final passes fluffed by kdb and bernardo silva 
i find everyone gets bullied weghorst and akinfenwa getting slapped all over the park off sterling and bernardo silva 
tchouameni backup rb a rw hopefully bernardo silva a backup st maybe de tomas but idk if he'd wanna be backup 
bernardo silva 7 stamina man start to the season ain't fooling no one 
then put bernardo silva the worst owned player never performs whenever he's in my team 
are cencelo ruben dias pedri bernardo silva overrated before they purchased them it's not an option to buy at a higher price high prices are set for clubs with big money period 
bullshit bernardo silva is the player of the season 
see i saw something in the game he kept telling bernardo silva something he was literally begging him later he removed him and was still talking to him while gundogan was doing the assignment 
tchouameni nkunku bernardo silva amp james would be amazing 
i already do i played with bernardo silva rttk and changed to kovacic after so i'm pretty used to 80 
nah u def thinking about the run in don't forget the first half of the season they were saying bernardo silva the best on the team 🤷🏾‍♂️ couldn't have been all that influential 
in the end fernando santos will lineup jota lw and bernardo silva rw with ronaldo 😂 
bernardo silva 🇵🇹 manchester city my chosen signing after 5 years working with one of the best managers of all time he is mature enough to sign for real madrid he is rumoured to want to leave city and he was city's mvp against us in the whole tie which is impressive 
no with some like 15 more you can sign bernardo silva 
the best league in the world pep guardiola is the man subbed bernardo silva to bring gundogan changed the game in just 5 minutes from 0 2 down to 3 2 up genius absolute genius 
ratio bernardo silva is clear 
nice to get some respect from a city player at first i thought it was bernardo silva but then i thought……… nah 
bernardo silva is the best advanced 8 in the league so that's a difficult standard to hold other players to 
depends who leaves really but definitely a gk and lb with fernandinho leaving another defensive midfielder because rodri plays every game i've heard gundogan and bernardo silva might leave too but not sure 
fkin mount foden bernardo silva mane diaz salah zyech id even go as far to say hed be the next timo 
eh if you watch city year by year a lot of their lineup changes for example last year bernardo silva was out and this year he's first in same with sterling stones they change year to year btw gundogan made that call to leave 
who would you pick him over a similar player in today's starting city 11 assume it must be mahrez surely can't be de bruyne bernardo silva or foden 
washes bernardo silva in every aspect imo 
this seems too much in that case i'll play camavinga as defensive midfielder amp try to bring bernardo silva to boost our midfield 
bernardo silva would be a dream signing tbh 😂 
classy take note bernardo silva 
i really hope we keep him him and bernardo silva are very underrated bro 🤞 
did you watch bernardo silva this season kdb is untouchable as well you can't play everyone bro 
yessss tchouameni bernardo silva rudiger and we're cooking next season 
crucial goal pts bernardo silva manchester city end season 22 3 vs leicester city 3 vs burnley 3 vs aston villa 3 vs watford 3 vs real madrid total 15 
2 of them nkunku is very versatyle player more than bernardo silva son can be a solution at the rw 
no he's very reckless playing as a starter he makes a lot of wrong decisions on the field but moves that he doesn't always make go viral i prefeer bernardo silva or nkunku 
was city top scorer last season lost most of his game to bernardo silva this season but still become the club hero in the last match sub hero 
sign reece james tchouameni anthony and bernardo silva 
bernardo silva is perfect for me thank you already do you prefer dm 
jack grealish and bernardo silva really lol 
bernardo silva and kyle walker eplfinaleondstv 
the final sub gundogan offered a better runner into the box from midfield than bernardo silva 
bernardo silva the goat 
bernardo silva all day 
yup and i still don't want him i need bernardo silva 
bernardo silva tchouameni a right back would be the perfect plan b 
we don't actually need a backup striker rodrygo is that if we are able to get bernardo silva we can have one great player who can play both in midfield and frontline 
aswear especially bernardo silva 
have you seen bernardo silva's touch 
special mentions 🌟 diogo jota 385 pts james maddison 392 pts bernardo silva 385 pts all these guys were great much love ♥️ next season will be massive 💪 
bernardo silva will do it 🙂 
on 93 minutes bernardo silva put on early cross anddd de bruyneeeee its late really late goal to conceal the title oh what a goal test2 
the bernardo silva disrespect honestly 
salah son vvd deffo debatably bernardo silva who carried city first half of the season and trent being trent 
interesting i would be just fine with any of those players i really want bernardo silva but i don't see manchester city selling him what about raheem sterling or antony maybe just maybe eden hazard re finds his form 👀 
guardiola talking to bernardo silva 
🥅 bernardo silva to score or assist 📒 jacob ramsey to be carded 
bernardo leão nkunku gnabry darwin n these four for me maybe sign 3 of them salah old and big money same for mané and mahrez 30y o over and raphina is barcelona player so he is out we need right winger gt bernardo silva cm rw nkunku lw cf cm rw best buy them both 
we'll see what happens took a punt on bernardo silva too 
get a world class rb still can't believe we let hakimi go and an understudy for benzema if avail maybe an attacking mid bernardo silva 
would bernardo silva be a good move for madrid 
you dey watch ball at all all this plastic fan wey just start to dey watch ball 2022 he got his first assist of the season december 29 he was never involved all till december pep said it himself best player is bernardo silva not this ghost of a player showing up end season 
first assist bernardo silva 
like pep says good players make him a good coach cos how can you teach what de bruyne does on the pitch or what bernardo silva does or what hazard used to do for chelsea chelsea forward players or creative players lack inventiveness 
first assist bernardo silva score mancity 3 0 aston villa 
the lad who was sporting director for monoco when they got mbappe mendy bernardo silva etc 
tchouameni for 70 mil kounde for 75 mil nunez or jesus bernardo silva if he costs less than 50mil game set match 
mentioned on the podcast yesterday but love the bernardo silva option can be a cm that provides more end production and or plug him on the rw if we are looking for more control and less width verticality interchange with rodyrgo valverde modric in those spots 
that bernardo silva own and that joshua king i swear i won ment that day 😭 he'll now make one normal save and exaggerate it to fool and captain my foot 
like the swallow hazard mahrez and bernardo silva 
first assist bernardo silva scoreline 3 1 theabsaassist absagoalrush 
yeah like how they swallow mahrez and bernardo silva huh or hazard 🤔 
bernardo silva to score or assist mings card 
singlehandedly bernardo silva mahrez and j cancelo seems a joke to you kdb wasn't even to be seen for the first half of the season 
bernardo is a proper cm isco is a 10 unlike silva 
haaland will never be clear of mbappe they must ask bernardo silva about kylian m'bappe 
and pep who can choose between old fernandinho or rodri and mahrez or bernardo silva there's diaz jota salah and mane for another team and fan base wants us to compete for the league with lukaku that doesn't even get enough passes because mount is after goals and werner 
thanks mate will get bernardo silva the now 
first assist bernardo silva first goal phil foden 
if the bernardo silva isnt a loan then play him over jwp 
but bernardo silva wouldn't play for klopp does that make him a bad player it's not like pep is a perfect player signer anyway i mean look at grealish 🤷🏾 
foden plays with top talents like bernardo silva and kdb in a system he's been playing for over 5 years under a single manager mount is playing with deadwood players who can't finish a single big chance to save their lives tell yourself whatever you want to believe though 
he does more for his team than bernardo silva does you seem to think context doesn't matter you have a man city team that's so full of quality that every player makes the other better then you have a chelsea team with bottlers like pulisic werner and scamvertz 
theabsaassist absagoalrush first assist bernardo silva score line 1 1 
all the gammons celebrating another african player being robbed of individual awards talkshite have been desperate for someone other than salah to win it since october touting everyone from ronaldo bernardo silva to kane 
i think bernardo silva is more than enough and if it is below market price i'd for gnabry 
kounde can play as rb i think 70 80 million i guess bernardo silva or antoy from ajax can be enough 
tchouameni 100 bernardo s or gnabry i like both silva can be more versatile ganbry is younger i hope rodrygo have a historical breakthrough season like vini so… reece james is a doubt but would be fantastic otherwise jude in 2023 is a dream hopefully not a nightmare then 
sell asensio jovic ceballos and mariano buy tchouaméni fran garcia bernardo silva mahrez and a back up striker for benzema rdt or use rodrygo as a cf every position is covered by at least two players then for 200 250 million 
bernardo silva after him will be top for the team and a rw and of course a rb or lb even low costs ones 
so take away all ronaldo's ballon dors then because he's also greedy de bruyne did fuck all until the last few months rodri bernardo silva and cancelo have all been more important 
bernardo silva is also good option can play midfield and in wing 
bernardo silva 8 10 solid season especially after not wanting to be here in the summer got his head down amp worked his performances did fade a little but with the amount of games he's played that's expected 
tchouameni nkunku bernardo silva reece james would be the perfect transfer window imo 
tchouameni gerard moreno bernardo silva and reece james atleast 
and it wasn't just mbappe the same summer the sold mendy and bernardo silva to city and bakayoko to chelsea for big money too they got over 400m in transfer fees that summer and the next summer was lemar to atleti and fabinho to liverpool another 100m 
bro torre won't start every game are you for real not every talent is pedri soler is sort of ok we won't elite talents we should only sell frenkie if we can get someone like bernardo silva this 18 yr old kids will ultimately get tired by end of season 
bernardo silva has let himself go 
his team mate bernardo silva been superior over the full season imo 
my picks 👇 gnabry bernardo silva tchouameni reece james 
very true bernardo silva is a bit similar to him but with way more workrate 
base of urgency a world class rw creative midfield and proper backup lb should be enough i really want bernardo silva here next season 
why bernardo silva we lareadybhave fede to play that role we need proper winger to play at right side i would go for mahrez for 2 years till we go for jude 
ffs bernardo silva is not a bad option either 
just extended his contract bernardo silva clear 
pl physicality thing is a myth if you have ability look at bernardo foden david silva hazard etc… not physical monsters but fantastically technical 
reece james for right back spot bernardo silva for right wing bernardo is good defensively also and has a good work rate if madrid goes for a proper winger mahrez or salah imo 
bernardo silva og would be perfection for me 
jovic and mariano should go for scamacca jurrien timber for rb mahrez or chiesa for rw bernardo silva for midfield 
md 15 watford a 8 5 10 a dominant away win against a relegation side in watford 1 3 win away from home a brace from bernardo silva too 
i agree but i have salah to son conundrum to worry about so would have to take a 4 to bring him in over bernardo silva i am tempted but waiting on salah team news 
what you think about bernardo silva think he is good option or best option for mid under 8m 
bernardo silva loves it against aston villa 
3 bernardo silva amazing dribbler high work rate good at holding on to the ball defensively strong he might not have the explosiveness like some of the players om but he could play the isco role free roamer with valverde slotting into the rw when he drops to the midfield 
nkunku tchouameni bernardo silva we dont need a striker wait 2 years and have benz in top form in that period then activate haalands release clause and get him 
harry kane has the most goals and assists last season and he wasn't the player of the season it's not always about goals assists the only player that was robbed and deserves the player of the season 2021 2022 is bernardo silva 💯🤷🏾‍♂️ 
bernardo silva and mahrez would be lit 
probably bernardo silva so they can complete the set u fucking dogs 
tchouameni 70m nkunku 70 80m then either mahrez or bernardo silva preferably bernardo because younger and can play both rw and in midfield if possible get reece james aswell 
darwin nunez nkunku riyad mahrez bernardo silva reece james maybe we could choose 2 of these 🙄 
salah or bernardo silva on the right reece james at rb 
just like you always imply the most important thing in football is goals 👌 kdb scored more goals and that has factored in kdb winning it ahead of bernardo silva though 
if we let messi go then who is de jong he is not performing for a long time bernardo silva is a good option 
bernardo silva rw tchoumani sell jovic and mariano buy a decent back up st and a rb and we're good to go 
tchouameni and a back up striker for mbappe that's it personally i want to see bernardo silva in madrid 
get salah or mahrez rdt tchouameni porro bernardo silva if asensio leaves 
players such as bernardo silva lewandowski and cristiano ronaldo have offered themselves to realmadrid but because of age and competition in the role at the moment there is no interest 
still sticking with this ronaldo narrative i see when city play with de bruyne as false nine he doesn't press intensly either de bruyne block the passing lane into the opposition holding midfield player and bernardo silva runs beyond him to press the centre backs 
what do you think about bernardo silva as a signing 
gnabry bernardo silva tchouameni nunez if we get 3 out these 4 its really good imo 
there are so many but for me emi martínez to make a world record 33 saves in one match until bernardo silva scores on 90 2 only for phil coutinho to dribble past their entire team from the kick off 1 1 meanwhile at anfield it's 90 5 0 0 cometh the hour cometh the div 
tchouameni bernardo silva rudiger ✅ would be a great transfer window imo 
yeah i agree with u even though i prefer nkunku but the thing is i think we are more in the need of a right winger salah is really the perfect deal for us we also need to reinforce other areas tchouameni bernardo silva reece james… but yeah ure still right 
salah and bernardo silva can be good buy 
we should go for salah or bernardo silva 
ok if you get rid of him at least get bernardo silva not soler 🤡 
bernardo silva first assist 3 1 final score 
i mean i beg to differ really vini and benz are one of the most lethal duos in europe this season and vini has improved massively imo rodrygo is improving too but one reinforcement i would like to make in the attack is to get bernardo silva if possible 
a real right wing the perfect one would be salah a replacement back up for benzema tchouameni or bernardo silva even though this is really unrealistic i would just like it reece james in defense maybe it's not impossible 
rudiger tchouameni bernardo silva reece james isn't possible this summer so yeah 
from elite that's unlucky i've gotten elite 3 mitchell elite 2 bernardo silva dupe elite 1 kimmich 
what do you think about bernardo silva can play on the rw can be a good replacement for modric the closest we can actually go to replace him 28 years of age moreover he wanted to leave manchester last summer to be closer to his family i think he'd push for move himself too 
i would rather take bernardo silva who also has 1 year left in his contract left footed can play both at rw and cm occasionally as a false nine too only 27 still a few more years left in his prime and he works like a madman for his team 
worse still they made money good on bakayoko lemar bernardo silva and fabinho sales too 
i strongly disagree kdb was not on form for like the first 12 matches of the season bernardo silva was on hot form then salah has been consistent for liverpool all through the season if we are to talk about stats salah wins bro it was a daylight robbery 
bernardo silva tchouameni reece james and a backup striker 
real madrid said no to bernardo silva to lewandowski really 😳 
that's a whole lie man debruyne was below par first half of the season bernardo silva on the other has has always been there moh salah and mane have always been there 
i gotta question where did all those players start out their careers before they were picked up by big clubs henry came from monaco's academy so fabinho and bernardo silva arent 2 of the best players in the world lol ok later man 
wouldn't say the likes of bernardo silva gundogan have pnp that doesn't even matter though because the are press resistant how many players do we have like that 
⤵️ players such as bernardo silva lewandowski and cristiano ronaldo have offered themselves to realmadrid but because of age and competition in the role at the moment there is no interest 
any left back reece or muk for mid i have read of bernardo silva or gundo 
kdb literally didn't show up until february the first half of the season city fans were all talking like bernardo silva was prime zidane kdb didn't get a mention 
doesn't mean we should sign anyone bernardo silva mahrez suit more for us than salah 
prob a midfielder and wait for another striker maybe vlahovic if they really want a striker and maybe like bernardo silva if they want a midfielder 
bernardo silva is perfect in my opinion he can play as a cm too also antony or raphinha will be good too 
mahrez and salah are on a different planet then gnabry tbh what other signings would you make for me i'd go mahrez salah bernardo silva tchouaméni rudiger fran garcia raul de thomas no rb on the current market is worth spending money on 
darwin or antony and bernardo silva or cancelo 
bernardo silva as a shout accepted too might just pick him over every other option aj19 
logically we should be fine if we get bernardo silva or nkunku but i doubt… 
starring bernardo silva 😩 
i like to see bernardo silva instead of mahrez in 1 season he can replace modric and also he can play rw and false 9 
vinicius benzema salah doesn't sound bad add a midfielder or two like tchoumeni and bernardo silva rudiger alaba militao at the back could be enough for a few years until we get linked to mbappe again in 2 to 3 years 😂😂😂 
for me i think the only way to put the shitty story away is to sign either bernardo silva moh salah s gnabry for right back pedro poro even as we already have vinicius tobias midfield tchouameni j bellingham and finally left back fran garcia or promote miguel gutierrez 
any news on bernardo silva 
and maybe a playmaker like bernardo silva to enrich midfield area he seems pretty flexible as cam cm like modric i think could move and try him as rw as well and he is still 27 so 🤷🏻‍♀️ and most importantly he has spoken openly that he's interested playing for madrid 👌🏻 
more football intelligence abi arindin ni eleyi ni have you check bernardo silva mane son ward prowse and co football stats thus season 
madrid only need a backup someone who can take over in a couple year for 1 benzema i'd say darwin nuñez 2 modric i'd say bernardo silva but that's a hard one to get 3 casemiro tchouameni is the clear choice there 
instead of going for neymar or pogba as statement signings chelsea can go for mane salah bernardo silva gundagon chiesa koulibaly dembele son etc these guys are real marque signings n proven commodities too neymar n pogba ll spoil the dressing room n eat ur wage bill 
we need a world class rw apart from tchouameni at least gnabry mahrez bernardo silva antony salah would be great 
i rather kms thank you before seeing bernardo silva at rw 
slow start to the season but wow what a finish player of the season for me would be bernardo silva or son 
damn great deal with bernardo silva to 
in christianity and islam the prophets jesus and muhammad are both heralded by the angel gabriel again there is no indication as to whether gabriel is acting on the lord's behalf or his own gabriel corresponds to the planet mercury 
gabriel jesus and afc 
last summer makes me think otherwise if they actually choose to buy players i think they'll make good signings it's just january calls that into question hahaha i think itll be fine two good indicators will be the gabriel jesus new forward and saliba situations 
i'm telling you people are sleeping on this gabriel jesus transfer this is massive him odegaard and saka will be so cleaaan 
if gundo and sterling go with haland and fdj coming in your squads worse also if gabriel jesus goes ur squad is worse again 
still better than gabriel jesus him mate 
gabriel jesus he's on free 
cool but now sign gabriel jesus and scamacca 
arsenal want gabriel jesus as priority and nothing has changed even after missing on champions league spot race 
wtf guy 😂 it's gabriel jesus 
is gabriel jesus not a striker nwanneka 
prophet jesus never died for our sins because allah said he rose jesus to him self prophet muhammad could not read or write angel gabriel recited the verses of the quran to muhammad and then muhammad peace be upon him recited it to his companions 
i'm not necessarily arteta in but do you not think with a striker like gabriel jesus there's so much potential 
we up cos of gabriel jesus 
gabriel jesus it is time 
up because of gabriel jesus chai 
gabriel you cannot say things like this when the fate of qualification lies in the hands of jesus you must apologize to liljay right now 
thank god i made jesus christ my priority let arsenal go and make gabriel jesus their own priority 
none of those clubs can afford him though nor would gabriel jesus want to play in a non top 5 league 
that's where the problem will be they would get in gabriel jesus and they think they have done something spectacular 
but gabriel jesus do not want them he doesn't want to miss cl football 
gabriel jesus has enough premier league medals to lace boots with the ribbon 😘 
but gabriel jesus do not want them he doesn't want to miss cl football 
yeahh rumors keep getting stronger and stronger for gabriel jesus nketieh finished off season strong but need a striker to push him and be able to get 10 15 goals a season in the prem thats what we were missing this season a quality consistent striker 
😒😒😒it will happen in jesus' name 🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️ 
we'll trade you gabriel jesus amp raheem sterling 30m for mike maignan and theo hernandez deal 
we need to have a good summer looks like we're in for gabriel jesus which is nice i think he can help us get it as a lot of our issue was lack of a good striker laca couldn't even outscore gabriel and mikel kept him for too long but if not i wouldn't care if he went 
we have no strikers lol what do you want just gabriel jesus and then what lacazette and nketiah are not good enough for arsenal and thankfully leaving so what do you want 
gabriel jesus and dcl won't get 20 goals man 
gabriel jesus would be brilliant great presser and quality striker going into his prime 
gabriel jesus is number 2 right 😂😂 
the representatives of gabriel jesus are already in manchester and will meet city's management in the coming days to present the offers from arsenal and other clubs city are hoping to receive a fee in the region of £42m £52m 
yeah it's looking long for us might have to be a season where we put all eggs in one basket and pray we win europa 😂 i'm hearing that gabriel jesus could actually be happening though decent for us if true 
gabriel jesus 55 60 mil with 1 year left seriously hadn't broke 14 goals in the league with the best team in it some player 👍 
• versatile fb • saliba or another cb better than holding • tielemans • new rw or reiss nelson • gabriel jesus • a new giroud 
gabriel jesus is only 25 and pep has tried too keep him for this long he's would make out team a million times better 
nothing huge is happening aaron hickey gabriel jesus and that's all 
never forget gabriel jesus time wasting efforts in added time at some point city couldn't wait for the clock to run down and jesus was doing his own tactics at the corner flag 
that rules gabriel jesus out then 
only got chills from gabriel jesus me 
what are you smoking gabriel jesus is not an elite and proven cf striker his track record is very suspect he is not real madrid material he does have some upside as he is just 25 years old but really danny wellback has upside 
yeah something like gabriel jesus tammy abraham coady gakpo 
the universe evening out for the gabriel jesus thrill 
did you see what pep did wit la masia boys in barca how big was kelvin de bruyne phil foden mahrez gabriel jesus please mention 5big stars that's been signed to join man city in the last 2years i'll mention 8 in man united mtcheeeew 
i support gabriel jesus so i won a trophy today mate 
arteta i love you but i love this club more 2nd or first next season or your gone martinelli nkunku saka tielemans xhaka odegaard tierney gabriel saliba tomiyasu ramsdale jesus ben white esr marquinhos holding hickey amari hutchinson pls arteta throw 120 mil at nkunku pls 
the ref was decent tho he was unbiased absolutely outstanding from him zichenki rodri steeling gundogan and foden are standouts big ups to gabriel jesus for holding it down in the last 7 minutes 
they should be scouting raphael leao christopher nkunku jude bellingham nunez gabriel jesus son dybala bernadeschi for advanced positions three from this list will do sell some attackers too angelino should be considered for lb position though underrated 
that's true o gabriel jesus na center forward 
is his all enough gabriel jesus gave his all when asked he is currently on the market that's a top club right there 
bissouma amp gabriel jesus are my must buys this summer 
barcelona needs a player like gabriel jesus crack 
barcelona needs a player like gabriel jesus crack 
barcelona needs a player like gabriel jesus crack 
ok now focus sur gabriel jesus lautaro saliba and good midfielders quick no time to waste 
who is gabriel jesus 
minimum of two great and experienced strikers gabriel jesus osinmehen nunez a replacement for kieran tierney takiro tomiyasu ben white and possibly partey saliba and toriera back in the squad 6 players that's all we need if you don't wanna see craze 
is gabriel jesus a left back your just a jumped up drummer from the arctic monkeys 
its looking like the gabriel jesus one will be long i hope not though 
really tielemans nunez gabriel jesus even our saliba won't all deem us worthy when we go knocking because we won't be playing in the champions league next season can there be a bigger blow to the project 
would you want gabriel jesus if he was willing to come 
gabriel jesus is a cb 
i really hope we get gabriel jesus 
the player in question gabriel jesus is your striker period don't find excuses to justify peps actions 
listen up now because we need this players kaylor navas gk mukiele rb tielemans cm bissouma cdm renato sanches cm zaha lw gabriel jesus st darwin nunez st get some of them i promise you we will do better next seaon we might even win el ✌️ 
you nailed it down madam had it been we have better striker this season we will be on champion's league now even gabriel jesus alone cannot do it to me i didn't see him as a striker that can stand alone 
laca scored 4 goals auba didnt even move around on the pitch and they had gabriel jesus 
gabriel jesus 7 various different purple patches throughout the season we can't beat him 
u still get mind bring this issue after what happened in the ucl infact what's gabriel jesus 
gabriel jesus plays golf 
no gabriel jesus is better 
is gabriel jesus a plumber 
i'd elect darwin nunez antony tchouamenni and gabriel jesus he would be a great player for us 
better than gabriel jesus in my books 
we need new fresh players in the likes of tielemans gabriel jesus nunez even jovic would be a top signing we need this kind of players to move on and win el next season 
his minutes per goal is miles better than gabriel jesus and it's even better than kane ffs 😂 jesus 235 mins per goal kane 190 mins per goal he'd be an ideal no cost 2nd striker if we go spend big money on a 1st choice 
gabriel jesus plays tennis then 
gabriel jesus not a striker big dog 
not really check the tape i remember a game where gabriel jesus scores and van dijk plays offside while trent is beaten 
lol… how many goal does gabriel jesus have 
weverton play in palmeiras which revealed gabriel jesús he took the penalty in the 2016 olympic games against germany and gave brazil his first gold medal in football with him palmeiras win two 'libertadores' in a row he is the best active archer in south america 
most are going to say what a player he is when they slandered him the last 4 weeks whereas i have stood by these players when they were at theyre worst example sterling zinchenko fernandinho ederson gabriel jesus 
massive 👏🏾👏🏾to gabriel jesus there 
so if pep in his craziness decides to play haaland from the flanks next season the media will still say there's no centre forward in your team abi they just chose not to see gabriel jesus 
partey was in ucl playing club too so was gabriel magalhaes gabriel jesus is also currently in a ucl team but arsenal are still favourites to land him nothing is impossible 
we need to add depth and quality gabriel jesus osimhen neto 2 fullbacks and bring back saliba this would definitely be a great business if we ever want to get back to the top 
mahrez missed it against west ham not gabriel jesus 
you can't attract that big goal getters anymore unless you are putting gabriel jesus in that category 
gabriel jesus celebrating the last trophy in his career 😭 
gabriel jesus update boss man have arsenal made a bid 
what do you think of our chances for lautaro with europa he should be the one and not gabriel jesus if we must overpay 
we better be buying a top striker next season with gabriel jesus as bonus on the left flank 
i am sorry gabriel jesus but that's your last league title for now 
z give us a gabriel jesus bomba 
we need a big summer for quality and squad depth and would like us to try and get the following players hickey tielemans gabriel jesus ricarlison 
isn't gabriel jesus a striker 
i never knew gabriel jèsus was a goalkeeper wow noted now🥴 
it's an award…voted by fans our fans so it's literally based on opinions never known fans to hate their own player sm bet if gabriel jesus won city's pots ahead of de bruyne they wouldn't care because it's still they're player silva deserved it but it's done now 
give gabriel jesus amp gundogan new contract or dont let them leave 
gabriel jesus seeing that arsenal want him 
gabriel jesus abraham gakpo neves and hickey would be 💯 
no no no it's gabriel jesus 😬😬 
gabriel jesus as main striker dcl as back up for next season 
weird to see gabriel jesus doing so well in mancity under guardiola but performing so poorly in brazilian national team under tite 
we welcome gabriel jesus 
gabriel jesus is a goat 
do think gabriel jesus gives you guys enough goals seeing as he's one that's supposedly coming next season 
calvert lewin tielemans and gabriel jesus😭 
gabriel jesus be goalkeeper 
announce marquinhos frenkie de jong aaron hickey william saliba gabriel jesus etc 
see why gabriel jesus was hogging ball cos he knows he's finished 😂 
buy gabriel jesus ✅ jonathan david ✅ ruben neves or renato sanches ✅ bring back william saliba ✅ 
grealish come on man i never believed he could be as good as aguero gabriel jesus gundogan mahrez or even kevin de bruyne 
gundogan may to out from city in end season gabriel jesus i'm not sure he will stay and play for city next season 
haha i can't agree with you on this one 😅 still hope we pull off gabriel jesus 🙏🏻 
gabriel jesus was made for time wasting hes so good at it everytime we need him 
go go go city you are a beast gabriel jesus was a fortress in the end congratulations city positive energies from brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷 to you 
don't think gabriel jesus wants to play in the 
announce gabriel jesus 
announce gabriel jesus 
gabriel jesus first 
next season city players are banned from my team gabriel jesus one of the worst signings i've ever made 
i like that you're able to hold my candidate to high standards i totally love it we need better conversations on who becomes our leader so i'll be chilled and wait for your candidate it better be angel gabriel or jesus the second 
i dont think a new prem title would even mean much to him i love klopp and the most important thing i have an annoying friend who loves gabriel jesus and if city could win without him i'd be fine with it sjsjsksk 
for clarification it's not gabriel jesus she's talking about 
gabriel jesus so shite 
thank u pep for bottling us the league 🤡🤡 what tf is gabriel jesus doing on the pitch after being soo poooor abeg we need grealish to come on 
brooo gabriel jesus is so shit 😂😂😂 
shouldn't pursue gabriel jesus for europa league please consider other forwards 
never play gabriel jesus again 
zaha gabriel jesus bissouma that's it and we are back 
gabriel jesus decision making in this game is frustrating 
imagine if we get jesus… gabriel fc 
sometimes you just need such players to go route one now they're crossing the ball desperately for gabriel jesus to score 😂 
gabriel jesus this time 93rd minute 
watkins is another gabriel jesus 
should've been gabriel jesus 
bye gabriel jesus don't come back never again 
gabriel jesus would be greatttt ohhhh jeeessuuuuusss 
gabriel jesus fucking christed 
he's meant gabriel jesus but yeah he didn't force 
don't worry we got gabriel jesus who shoots the ball but it ends hitting his other foot 😭 
gabriel jesus is the problem he is too selfish 
don't need gabriel jesus eddie will get more goals arsenal need another prolific goal scorer with experience and a young gun as back up to eddie 
gabriel jesus mubbi nnyo today though wolves should be 3 1 up by now edison muffu nnyo as well dennis kigunddu of is better 
with gabriel jesus 😁 
gabriel jesus is the real city baller 
fernandinho flops time after time under pressure about to cause them goals gabriel jesus' decision making is off leave ref and play ball 
and gabriel jesus the face of that awful team 
gabriel jesus is not world class striker 
please note that joao cancelo rodri and gabriel jesus are not game winners in such instances they are game neutralizers they should stop shooting and starting passing 
specify please gabriel jesus 
also gabriel jesus he's just not the guy 
please do not buy gabriel jesus 😐 
still he should play elsewhere we need a new strike force my pick would be gabriel jesus amp dominic calvert lewin 
year 6 with no cl football for arsenal and they thought that they'd be getting osimhen and gabriel jesus 
riyad mahrez or gabriel jesus who can play both right wing as well as a center forward 
so no gabriel jesus for them 
anyone thought about gabriel jesus can play the number 9 and has played down both flanks for pep this season he's on the way out the club was talking to arsenal but that's arsenal lol 
🆚 ⚽️ cristiano ronaldo 🟰 8️⃣1️⃣3️⃣ goles ⚽️ mahrez 174 sterling 173 de bruyne 156 haaland 150 gabriel jesus 141 🟰 7️⃣9️⃣4️⃣ 
i wanna share some wisdom from the quran for u guys 1st ss when gabriel gives mary the news of a son even though she was barren 2nd ss when mary gave birth in the spring under a palm tree amp people accused mary of adultery and jesus spoke for her 3rd ss see for urself 
agreed gabriel jesus will be a start 
gabriel jesus gifting kevin de flection a rocket of a goal gt gt gt 
fit partey and xhaka is fine with me maybe pull back torreira in the mix odegaard has been excellent goals upfront needed for which we need a solid striker gabriel jesus does fine 
take him as long as gabriel jesus stays 
gabriel jesus' agent has literally said they're chatting to arsenal as to be the main man there 
about gabriel jesus 
gabriel jesus as benzema's back up salah gnabry for right wing all this for 130m max this would improve out depth in attack as well 
gabriel jesus goal assist jacob ramsey carded 
sell arthur rabiot kean sandro buy sms and gabriel jesus on loan 
gabriel jesus 90 5' to make it 7 1 
gabriel jesus to score and xhaka to be carded 
gabriel jesus to score granit xhaka to be carded 
gabriel jesus great replacement for gnabry imo or even play him at st he's fast moves around a lot could be unpredictable 
gabriel jesus to score and luke shaw to be booked 
considering recent events it would probably be gabriel jesus or sterling 😆 
gabriel jesus will start 
him or gabriel jesus 🤔 
i'm a nigerian brov we don't rate him like that he's pure average gabriel jesus is miles off him 
i'm very tempted to bring in gabriel jesus it's expected to be his final game for city they're playing at home and there's a rumour that martinez won't be starting in goal for villa 🤔 
this is the gabriel jesus arsenal going to get i hope arsenal don't bottle this move 
i would've loved gabriel jesus but he's not looking to be second fiddle to benzema or anyone i think he wants to be a starter so honestly i would go for schick david or gouiri 
no one thinking about gabriel jesus fantastic player that city willing to sell 
£93m for osimhen his worth £50m at most osimhen £50m nunez £50m tammy abraham £45m gabriel jesus £35m cody gakpo £35m patrick shick £30m jonathan david £30m taiwo awoniyi £25m no guarantee those players will give us 20 goals in the epl 
at this point we need it but fr though gabriel jesus could be good for us only thing is british club inflated sum of money so i can imagine them asking for 60m 
loads of sources seem to be linking to tchouaméni i think they'll complete this move very quickly i reckon they'll definitely sign an attacker too as to who i've no idea my choice would be gabriel jesus or nkunku 
signed him in october 2021 released him when the russian league was banned by uefa after the ukrainian invasion plus arsenal needs not just quality but quantity in potential striker targets as well gabriel jesus is a quality player and botheim is basically similar to haaland 
we are not talking about punk we are talking about the tweets you quoted jesus christ my head hurts from the logic loops you are doing 
he doesn't suit arsenal style of play gabriel jesus is the perfect fit 
gabriel jesus 6 10 good start disappeared like he always does then started to play well again basically sums up his manchester city career with haaland coming in i think it's best if we move on jesus 
jesus christ look at those girls😫😭😭😭 so beautiful 
they should use it to sign gabriel jesus and ruben neves 
md 33 watford h 9 5 10 only reason for a 9 5 is because we conceded a preventable goal to win 5 1 at home and gabriel jesus to score 4 goals is insane and of course a thunderbolt goal again from rodri this man only scores bangers 
yeah and there are plenty options for back up striker right now gabriel jesus nkunku richarlison etc i won't mind some support at rw too raphinha of leeds won't cost much 
md 6 chelsea a 7 5 10 matching winning goal from gabriel jesus and to beat a title contender away from home 0 1 was a huge boost after some struggling in games 
yo do you think gabriel jesus is a good punt for this week 
why are we not paying attention to gabriel jesus man city is ready to sell for 50 55 amp is think that's a good option can also play across the attack 
wait they're not playing each other 🤣 liverpool will win 5 0 wolves city will win 3 0 villa mo salah to score for liverpool gabriel jesus for city 
vardy or gabriel jesus 
first assist gabriel jesus final score 3 0 
first assist gabriel jesus score line manchester city 3 aston villa 1 
first assist gabriel jesus scoreline 4 1 mancity 
tchouameni pogba raphinha and reece james or porro we sell jovic asensio ceballos mariano and buy someone like gabriel jesus for st position 
salah mahrez o dembele ik it's not possible rdt or gabriel jesus as a sub for benz try for tchouchameni go all out for reece james or pedro porro 
gabriel jesus it's his second for the evening manchester city extends their lead manchester city 4 0 aston villa 63' 
sorry 😄 i mean gabriel jesus 
gabriel jesus first assist score line mancity 4 aston villa 1 
he's been my first choice since last season 2 gt tammy abraham 3 gt ivan toney 4 gt gabriel jesus 5 gt victor osimhen 6 gt martin terrier 
pls gabriel jesus as benzema's back up he's leaving city and can also play as right winger 
pls gabriel jesus as benzema's back up he's leaving city and can also play as right winger 
akh some people though it's gabriel jesus not christ jesus ffs🚮 
well if gabriel jesus come with am abi 
here comes the false dm with gabriel jesus as dm and rodri as a 9 
dm backup tchouameni rb reece james st backup gabriel jesus maybe 
i would also go for gabriel jesus since he can be benzema backup and also can move to rw like this season 
currently feel like i'm the only person in fpl that think gabriel jesus is the one today no real mentions anywhere in for watkins and captain am i mental 
in my opinion we should go for gabriel jesus he can also play as striker 
a right winger and gabriel jesus as benzema's backup would be a fantastic window 
pls real madrid get gabriel jesus as benzema's backup🙏 
arsenal should walk away from that gabriel jesus deal we can wait for another 12 months and have him on a free if he truly wants arsenal he will come 
why not gabriel jesus mainly a right winger his finishing is amazing can play striker will come on cheap as city willing to sell young brazilian trio… 
get jonathan david if no gabriel jesus if not both then work for one of the rest 
we need prayer cos i want watch arsenal in ucl and i like to see gabriel jesus and dybala in london red and white 
buy gabriel jesus who can play as a striker as well as right winger 
dont worry wavy jacob and gabriel i am jesus jesus blesses you🙏🙏🙌🙌😇 
gabriel jesus also a good option for backup striker and right winger🤔 
broo ya'll celebrating acquiring gabriel jesus like ya'll won champions league im deceased 
you can get gabriel jesus before arsenal signs him 😆 
gabriel jesus come on he is too good for woolwich 
for a backup striker gabriel jesus danjuma richardson nkunku rdt amp recall mayoral mariano n jovic should be sold 
let's not create another pepe here stick with gabriel jesus he is good in epl 
er ok joe cole eh well we've got joe grea oh never mind matty cash maybe anyway head to the wheatsheaf any time next season to watch with the best supporters in the city 
100 million matty cash clear 
if we bargain hunt in the championship and sign another bowen then i really don't care where we sign players from does this logic also mean matty cash isn't very good by your logic 
matty cash 29 2 58 pts 
just a reminder bottled a 5 3 aggregate lead in 10 mins bottled a 13 pt cushion and let the league come down to the last day allowed 2 goals on 2 shots on target and needed a matty cash tyrone mings disaster class to clinch the title hope this helps 
awww you didn't get matty cash wanted to stay at villa kamara wants a bit of villa too and i reckon suarez is on his way on a free cheers pal 👍 
less goal contributions than matty cash 
matty cash both ilkay goals not marking his man or back post 🙃 
the last one is matty cash fella falls asleep at the back post and never cares to check his shoulder if he sees gundo he might've been able to get a foot to it or something 
matty cash or trent alexander arnold there's only one answer here 
matty cash masterclass 
soler y matty cash

beat aston villa in an extraordinary turnaround 3x2 on sunday pep guardiola's team scored by rodri hernández and ilkay gundogan 2x while steven gerrard's team scored by matty cash and philippe coutinho 
how much should people get for getting wrongfully whipped and spending their entire lives in slavery it sounds like their descendants have awful lot of cash with their name on them 
now that pukki is gone but never forgotten i can put more effort into building the matty cash propaganda empire

that's a cash exchange matty not a ride source 🤣🤣 
idk man i don't think gerrard can do too much when tyrone mings literally passes the ball to debruyne and just doesn't challenge his cross into the box 
shush nearly bottled the league flukes scored two flukey goals from a gift from tyrone mings 
tyrone mings is fucking class 
just shows how truly awful tyrone mings is 
just a reminder bottled a 5 3 aggregate lead in 10 mins bottled a 13 pt cushion and let the league come down to the last day allowed 2 goals on 2 shots on target and needed a matty cash tyrone mings disaster class to clinch the title hope this helps 
they had tyrone mings and roben olsen 🤣🤣 plus we fully never expected a league title since about november 
that tyrone mings touch for city's win makes me sick 
tyrone mings 
you did your part man tyrone mings is just total shite 
tyrone mings for me has to go 
tyrone mings saved leeds from the shit tyrone mings saved leeds from the shit 
tyrone mings…

it's mad that tyrone mings one of the worst defenders in the prem gets picked for england every time over tomori tbf 
tyrone mings that's all i have to say 
no o…watch them put tyrone mings and maguire 
tyrone mings is f cking class🤝🏼😭 
loads of tyrone mings to come 
not tyrone mings but it's impeccable for harry maguire to be in that squad for the world cup 
1 inky ball bag there's only 1 inky ball bag where can i donate brother tyrone mings 🎶🎶🎶🎵🎶🎶 
you'll never find leeds fans thanking canos even if he scored a hat trick of own goals but newcastle and tyrone mings yes we've thanked them already 👍 
saved us plain and simple this saved us tyrone mings is fucking brilliant 
big man all is forgiven leeds fans 🤝 tyrone mings lufc avfc 
not tyrone mings 
tyrone mings he kept you up tyrone mings he kept you up 👏 
could be worse you could have said you'd get tyrone mings' arse tattooed on your face 
pretty sure we won't sing the tyrone mings song again 
forget about them tarkowski mate you're coming to be tyrone mings backup next season 👍🤝 
on a totally unrelated note tyrone mings is a very beautiful man phwoar 
tyrone mings he's fucking great 🎶 
needs to be tyrone mings is f brilliant from here on in 😂 what a few days 
southgate somehow doesnt think hes better than tyrone mings 
will say thank you now to tyrone mings he is not fucking shite anymore🤣 
if at a leeds united v aston villa match again i'm not sure i'll join in with the tyrone mings is f cking sh t chant again it was one if the best blocks i've ever seen seriously good defending 
tyrone mings kept you up 
they would have still scored 3 villa got tyrone mings and some unknown gk today but seriously 3 goals in 5 minutes did they just stop playing for those 5 mins 
tyrone mings and n'castle united alus loved em ☺️ 
lucky we had tyrone mings to gift the ball to kdb i hope we never see him in a villa shirt again terrible mistake yet again 
right lads n lasses any tattooists who will do me a free tattoo i said if we stay up i'd get a tattoo of tyrone mings frenching callum wilson i'm a man of my word 😂 
tyrone mings is on your arse tyrone mings is on your arse 
up the fucking tyrone mings i owe you a pint lad 
tyrone mings is to defending what the mccanns are to babysitting 
🎶 tyrone mings is fucking ace 🎶 
1 has to be the 3 2 city comeback on final day no recency bias just think about it 2 newcastle 2 0 arsenal ucl gone 3 eddie howe won similar points to conte in a much worse team 4 son 5 tyrone mings villa will be so better without him 
mental that he won't even get a look in from southgate because he loves the prem and tyrone mings 
thank you tyrone mings 😅 
he's got tyrone mings as his top choice centreback this is a learning experience though 
at least you picked a decent looking footballer you could have much worse faces on your arse than tyrone mings 
newcastle tyrone mings and joffy we owe you all a toast 
got to be better than tyrone mings 😂 
if not for tyrone mings i'd have been wrong 
paid tyrone mings at half time 
two words tyrone mings 
that tyrone mings don receive alert from those arabians we move sha 
tyrone mings how no one clocked his poor clearance for city's 3rd is hilarious to me 
you don't have tyrone mings 
fine margins adverse penalty decisions missing that one at west ham tyrone mings block 
but southgate still thinks fikayo tomori is not better than tyrone mings connor coady or harry maguire 
and tyrone mings 
yep unfortunately with tyrone mings at cb city always had a great chance 
first 70 mins villa playing the football they think they can play last 20 mins 14th place villa at their best tyrone mings omfg is poison 
if tyrone mings and ollie watkins start our first game next season then it'll be the same old same old both not good enough for the pl 
lol i don't know if you're tryna catch one but how do you expect tyrone mings to defend against these lot the city vs liverpool game was the decider 
can't believe you've forgotten tyrone mings thursday night that goes in we were down 
i present to you mr tyrone mings 
tyrone for mings' block 
tyrone mings couldn't get in my sunday league team shoulda stuck to selling houses 
tyrone mings fault on the 3rd goal 
gerrard a a good manager just a shame he has to play tyrone mings at cb 
i could against tyrone mings bore off liverpool were dog shit before klopp liverpool win the cl we've had the better season end of story off to paris we go 
lol they employ tyrone mings mate that's alone is red flag though he did well today can only fault the goalkeeper on the 2nd goal also we can't expect them to beat city when we couldn't l 
if anybody thinks watkins and tyrone mings are good enough for villa then expect the same next season 
lol defend what with tyrone mings 😂😂 
tyrone fcking mings 
agree also i love tyrone mings but he has to go 
also tyrone mings 
na tyrone mings fucc up 
why are you typing in tyrone mings on twitter search bar ya fucking weapon 
tyrone mings masterclass nothing else 
tyrone fucking mings 
tyrone mings is fucking quality 💙 
only because we employ tyrone mings 
lucas signed and tyrone mings that's how 
i didn't have any hope until i saw 2 0 … tyrone mings is an abomination 
tyrone mings obviously played a blinder ffs 
i blame tyrone mings 
tyrone mings leeds united legend discuss 
tyrone mings is the only name u need 
tyrone mings has blood on his hands 
tyrone mings until he leaves we're gonna keep on conceding silly goals 
naa man i'm vexed🤬 i got an exam and now i can't even revise😂😂 how tf u conceding 3 in 5 minutes tyrone mings shouldn't be a footballer 
any team with tyrone mings as club captain is in serious trouble 
init my guy struggled against a team that has tyrone mings at the back 💀 
no tyrone mings is a shocking footballer 
2 0 as well just shows how bad tyrone mings is 
tyrone mings makes harry maguire look like maldini 
my bet is tyrone mings fault 
tyrone mings genuinely won a competition to be a footballer you can't prove otherwise 
tyrone mings played his part for leeds hope your fans are nicer to him next season providing his still at villa if not i don't care 
tyrone mings tax i am in disbelief why could they not have just hammered them from the off sold us an actual dream 
fucking tyrone mings at the back what do you expect 
sack tyrone mings off next season please 
tyrone van mings living up to his name an all only man city could conjure up such an escape 
tyrone mings to city next season 
i just how i mean when you have tyrone mings no lead is safe 
3 goals in 3 minutes tyrone mings is dead to me forever 
tyrone mings is a horrendous footballer 
i think it was tyrone mings who gave the ball away 
sell tyrone mings immediately 
wasn't him was the corrupt officials and tyrone mings 
what do you expect from tyrone mings 
i hope tyrone mings enjoys that money sheikh mansour direct debited him at half time 
imagine expecting tyrone mings to win a league for your team 
tyrone mings was absolutely abysmal for their third goal just passes it out to them 
if only tyrone mings didn't play for your club 🙏 
tyrone mings 
we really expected a team with tyrone mings to help us smh 
tyrone mings 
tyrone mings assisted on danny ings first goal and it was very fun 
tyrone fucking mings 
french tyrone mings 
man said fair play mate did you see tyrone mings 
tyrone mings is dusted 
tyrone mings mvp 
since making his premier league debut tyrone mings has committed the most fouls per game without being booked villain 
i foresee an own goal or penalty from tyrone mings mciavl 
french tyrone mings 
imagine if it's tyrone mings 
have hope rested in the ballsack of tyrone mings 
a perfect hat trick for tyrone mings one goal with each bollock and a goal with his helmet 
listen no disrespect but none or you will ever win anything but today you could stop someone else winning something tears in tyrone mings eyes 
😂😂 reality brother as much as i wanna go into the game with all hope in the world i just don't see tyrone mings lasting the whole 90 minutes 
by the way tyrone mings doesn't know how to head a ball so a few bruyne cross is inevitable 
on top of that calum chambers amp tyrone mings 
tyrone mings watch today 
tyrone mings makes his 50th premier league appearance as our club captain today 💜💙 avfc utv vtid 
city get all the luck mind you tyrone mings is rubbish as well 
i think tyrone mings goal is up there the way he won the ball then got the goal great effort 
luis diaz anytime tyrone mings booked death taxes …… 
tyrone mings turns into prime maldini 
tyrone fucking mings😭😭😭 
im sure he's buzzing that he's been praised by tyrone mings 
i'm sure he's thrilled for the opportunity to play with tyrone mings 
now let me say i was delighted to see are captain make that block just so i could say to those villa fans that criticed mings proformances at the balk this season by saying we'll what a great bit of defending tyrone mings a man and my club s captain 💙 
nah it'll be a deflection off tyrone mings sending robin olsen the wrong way ffs 
unfortunately not tyrone mings is playing 
tyrone mings giving away a penalty within five minutes written all over it 
more like 84 mins it's 0 0 and tyrone mings dives in on jack grealish in the penalty area with a rash challenge 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️ 
when tyrone mings or gary neville talk about politics it doesn't suddenly footballise it 
tyrone mings 
they all go out the window when tyrone mings is playing 
there's only 1 tyrone mings 🤣 
early tyrone mings header followed by a danny ings dagger later on👊 
stop it villa haven't beaten city for about 314 years it's at the etihad they have tyrone mings at the back as much as we would love him to help us gerrard isn't on the pitch to actually affect things but what if … 
those defensive stats are meaningless i'm afraid tyrone mings has more tackles blocks interceptions and clearances than vvd this season who's better 
score assist ollie watkins to be carded tyrone mings 
maybe wait til after the newcastle match as if there wasn't enough pressure on burnley fans who want them relegated is because their chairman sacked dyche ask tyrone mings about var burnew 
tyrone mings go sort we some cool pen 
villa have tyrone mings so i expect city to win 4 0 
raheem sterling to score or assist tyrone mings to be carded 
the way i see it is if they can put 4 past real madrid at home shouldn't be difficult with tyrone mings at the back🤣 
it's 2 minutes left and tyrone mings with a headerrrrr manchester city 1 2 aston villa 
raheem sterling to score or assist tyrone mings to be carded 
i just hope you are right i can't trust tyrone mings in the heart of that villa defence to stop the threat of kdb mahrez and co it gonna be tough but let's hope anything can happen in football 
believe in tyrone mings for 90mins i'm not even villa fans do 
mine lies in the hands of tyrone mings 
tyrone mings is also a liverpool fan 
so you'd rather have harry maguire amp tyrone mings ahead of thiago silva raheem stirling ahead of vinicius jr aladdin neymar amp fabiano walk into an england team 
the biggest problem today is tyrone mings liable to do anything 
guess we'll scam you for tyrone mings for £90 million he's the second coming of ramos 
mings was sent on loan to us in the championship to gain match fitness and game time after struggling with injuries 
also tyrone mings oddly 
kamada and kostic of frankfurt rashford as a striker only lingard and tyrone mings would be my choices 
will follow up the allegiance of this being my second club by defining and declaring it i will 100000 order a villa jersey prolly tyrone mings if they pull this off tomorrow please thank you an godspeed 
forgettable i genuinely think the few bright spots have been jacob ramsey's emergence as a first team player and the academy players like davis archer kesler hayden aziz barry at swindon marshall amp a ramsey all having positive loan spells 
6 jorginho odsonne edouard armando broja youri tielemans raul jimenez pablo fornals jacob ramsey rodrigo ademola lookman christian pulisic harvey barnes gabriel martinelli danny welbeck 
jacob ramsey could be moulded into that

as long as we dont get jacob ramsey scoring in the 5th minute and city replying straight away then scoring 4 more like they did in 2019 i'll be fine cant have that happen to us again 
it was alright jacob ramsey was one of the guys to pull 🤙🏼 
had to be gallagher for me like you say foden trent mount all established i even think that jacob ramsey at villa could of had a good shout 
de los equipos que descendieron destaco a los siguientes como opciones para el everton norwich max aarons watford ismaila sarr burnley james tarkowski agente libre nathan collins nick pope maxwel cornet dwight mcneil wout weghorst opciones low cost con las 3b 
max aarons is an obvious for sure maybe cornet 
nick pope max aarons james tarkowski and charlie taylor should be top priorities 
we already got the lb we should raid relegated teams and get phillips and max aarons we need two strikers jesus nkunku felix and nunez 
max aarons trying to deny us the daddy davies meme becoming reality 
thfc ryan sessegnon vs ncfc max aarons should be an exciting matchup today 🍿 nortot coys 
knauff impressed me the most especially because he was never a wingback disappointed most probably by max aarons 
as it stands unfortunately leeds are in for the drop but the goal difference is going to kill them spurs for top 4 unless we collapse against norwich can we bring back max aarons for next season too 
after rewatching and reviewing 55 west ham fixtures this season and finishing each game with player ratings kieran dowell's performance for norwich against us the other day came out pretty much rock bottom just thought i'd add to the positivity 
kieran dowell 😂😂 
lloris 9 10 hugely improved his distribution the 35 year old has been a brilliant shot stopper this season undeniably hugo's best season ever 
hugo lloris stalwart world cup winning captain captain even though some 'journalists' call kane the captain broke his clean sheets record this season with 16 every minute of the premier league season played rating 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 
goalkeeper of the season hugo lloris defender of the season rudigar midfielder of the season kdb striker of the season son coach of the season pep flop of the season player rashford useless club of the season man utd 
hugo lloris has more saves than alisson this season that says it all alisson hides behind van dijk and matip world class defenders 
totally agree we played 90 mns throwing the ball in hugo lloris zone 
not forgetting our captain hugo lloris 3rd most clean sheets behind ederson amp allison 
brazilian duo of alisson liverpool and ederson manchester city ends the season with 20 clean sheets each followed by hugo lloris tottenham hotspur 15 and edouard mendy of chelsea with 14 clean sheets fb 
hugo lloris 6 difficult one this season we still got a good shot stopper and i thought he was quite underrated at claiming sweeping and distributing at times however this season more than ever had me thinking about replacements his 2nd half of the season slump was 1 2 
stat race for the golden boot pl this season mohamed salah 22 heung min son 21 cristiano ronaldo 18 harry kane 16 race for the golden glove pl this season alisson 20 ederson 20 hugo lloris 15 edouard mendy 14 aaron ramsdale 12 
heard since tottenham and going for fraser forster the rangers are looking to sign hugo lloris with a fee of upto £60 million from that european money they got 
i am an expert in french football my uncle was an administrator at hugo lloris' old high school true story lol 
italians and french have names that sound good federico chiesa leonardo bonucci nicola barrela roberto mancini hugo lloris and lucas digne these are some football players though

yaaaaaaaaa davinson sanchez we hawtt 
davinson sánchez not a ton of appearances but he really has been good the final few matches when he was asked to come in and pick up where romero left off in absolutely crucial matches recency bias is strong but he did very admirably rating 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 
do you want davinson sanchez 
and davinson sanchez last minute header against watford 
davinson sanchez 7 extremely commendable season from him he was actually ok under nuno the few cleansheets we kept were with him in the side then he was crucial in our first run under conte and has shown himself to be an able romero backup deserves more respect 
davinson sanchez 6 5 10 extremely solid replacement for when romero was out huge improvement from last season and probably our most consistent when he played couldn't ask for a better backup 
it's definitely is cl quality spurs will be rocking up with eric dier ben davies and davinson sanchez to ucl nights our center half's are quality just need a stable midfield and full backs for a season and you'll see 
thoughts on davinson sanchez seems a better differential than sess 
eric dier 
future tottenham captain eric dier thinks so 
can't snub eric dier either 
dier 8 10 midfielder turned center back with romero's absence due to injury eric stepped his game up and showed us how to get the job done well played dier 
eric dier i've been an eric dier fan since his debut so there's 0 chance this review is unbiased but fuck me he's really been consistently vital for well over a season now this season was fire an absolute rock rating 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 
weird way to spell eric dier 
how many of us would have sold ben davies and eric dier in the summer i'd have certainly been open to it matt doherty emerson royal amp ryan sessegnon have been written off by many mid season and then all have ultimately showed their value once they've found their flow 
eric dier deserves it over those two as well 
goalkeeper allison defender eric dier midfielder bernardo s striker of the season son eddie howe flop of the season otu fernandez useless club of the season man utd 🤡 
in that chaotic fa cup defeat to norwich in 2020 my admiration of dier grew ten time fold when he was simply standing up for his brother the atmosphere was hostile that evening what with the public fear of incoming pandemic thank you eric dier for being the leader fthc 
eric fucking dier 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 
love that you brought up the high performance podcast i adore eric dier as a person very switched on and that episode is definitely a must listen 
like tomori should be automatic eric dier should also be in there never thought i'd be saying that a year ago 
eric dier better 
messi is good and all but can you change your profile to you and eric dier now please thanks 
dier 8 5 10 eric dier's best season in a spurs shirt 100 conte's 3 at the back suits him perfectly he has become a leader in the squad and one of our best players 
they've gained 4 more points than arsenal in that same time with only 1 major injury and it was to eric dier 
romero has made every single cb improve most notably eric dier has somehow turned into a reliable defender if maguire gets in the england squad dier should be the captain 🤣 
i love eric dier eric dier loves me 
it's good but it's no eric dier's pizza face 
eric dier uno wasn't ur brother getting abused by spurs fans 
why would eric dier care 
eric dier… deserves to be in england reckoning at cb 
eric dier has a 10 pack 😳😳😳

eric dier 8 like sanchez i think he was ok under nuno but under conte he went up a level he's the glue for our back 3 with his leadership and organization and turns out he's quite a good defender too what a turn around again very happy with him 
and eric dier loves you p 
i love eric dier 
eric dier 8 10 really outperformed himself especially considering how bad he was last season most important defender throughout majority of the season

gw8 was the week in which i rage transferred out eric dier after getting him come off the bench for a fourth consecutive week he never did anything apart from score an own goal 
eric dier enters chat 
you employ eric dier pipe down 
i love eric dier eric dier loves me 
you support a club with a really good future bro dw i think you'll get too 4 next season eric dier and ben davies at the back ain't gonna work for long 
just usual eric dier f ckups and we almost conceded a goal 
eric dier will always be a cock could cost us this game today 
30 seconds later eric dier gives the ball away and they almost score point made 
an eric dier own goal 🤲 
it's definitely is cl quality spurs will be rocking up with eric dier ben davies and davinson sanchez to ucl nights our center half's are quality just need a stable midfield and full backs for a season and you'll see 
lets goooooooo up the canaries pukki hat trick you can do it eric dier will get another red card 
c'mon eric dier get your last red card of the season i know you can do it 👍 
the reverse eric dier 
eric dier getting a red card in the first 2 mins of the game 
eric dier first minute own goal it is then 😬 
the amount of trust that every manager has given dier is something that we have to notice even if we do ens up bringing a replacement for eric one day we need him to stick around 
emerson royal improve the last few games 6 
royal 7 10 emerson's first game was vs crystal palace he got sent off on his debut fast forward to the past month royal has improved his overall game amp showed up in the big games liverpool love the commitment emerson 
same here mate i don't hate arteta because he's working with someone that wanted willian emerson royal and god knows who else we should of got someone experienced to work with arteta imo he's a great coach but needs someone above him like wenger had dein 
emerson royal wasn't convinced until the last half or so of the season was already doing well before doherty's injury but has almost made a claim to start over him now moving to rwb was at first hard natural rb but he's gotten much better in attack rating 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 
we played emerson royal at rwb and people think adama doesn't improve us 
how many of us would have sold ben davies and eric dier in the summer i'd have certainly been open to it matt doherty emerson royal amp ryan sessegnon have been written off by many mid season and then all have ultimately showed their value once they've found their flow 
did he say we've had nothing go in our favour nobhead yes we've had decisions too but none that affected the result like this and let's not forget kane two footing robbo amp emerson royal taking jota out in the area in the 2 2 at spurs now who put 50p in the dickhead 
he really has those automations in attack absolutely locked him the attacking shadow play drills must be really intense and repetitive ucl footy deserved need to replace emerson royal though 
royal comp 
keep royal he deserves a chance to prove himself 🙏🏼 
he should be talking of reece with his fellow wing backs the likes of emerson royal 
el king royal 🤩 
love you royal can't wait for the comp ' 
we have emerson royal and hojbjerg 😭 
look me in the eyes and tell me emerson royal will compete for the ucl title i dare you bruh 
thanks barkaaa emerson royal gt kyle walker chaaks 👑 
emerson royal 4 oh boy this guy has been such a poor fit he cannot cut it as a wb at all i don't think he's as bad as most will say and he's had decent games but as a rwb he's hopeless probably cash in this summer if possible nice guy tho i like him 
emerson royal with adobe premiere open lmaoo 😭 
emerson royal 1 10 awful excuse for a footballer 
davies and emerson royal being incredible in this run completely spun me antonio conte is god 
we got emerson royal for that hermano 
emerson royal who had your star boys in his pocket 😂 
worse than maguire holding emerson royal fernandinho as cb 
less than 2 hours till the emerson royal norwich comp 
we need to sell tomi unfortunately or keep him just a backup he has medical history of muscular injuries including hamistring and calf so it s not looking good and we can not depend on him next season unfortunately emerson royal proven better signing by spurs 
ima shake my ass for one last emerson royal comp 
you guys abused sky kaveh only for emerson royal to eclipse him 
so you're telling me that emerson royal who does not know how to cross a ball is champions league quality 
meaning kane sessegnon and emerson royal have all traveled they had bug and very likely start in an unchanged spurs lineup no surprises here 
he young and better then kos and will improve but i wouldn't say to much as you have emerson royal 😂😂😂 
playing emerson royal that's exactly what you were doing 
it's your chance to be known as champions league royal 
xhaka and emerson royal to be booked salah 2 or more and trent to assist 
who would have thought a few months ago i'd be fretting on the fitness of emerson royal and ryan sessegnon on the last day of the season 😂 
sessegnon 8 10 under conte ryan felt underlooked with reguilón in the first team picture there was no way for sessegnon to break into the starting 11 until he had his chance since then he's been our starting wing back partnering up with son at the left flank stellar 
ryan sessegnon what a player he's turning into his defending has visibly improved the latter third of this season alone and he's dangerous going forward plus great recovery speed when he does make a mistake excited for him going forward rating 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 
how many of us would have sold ben davies and eric dier in the summer i'd have certainly been open to it matt doherty emerson royal amp ryan sessegnon have been written off by many mid season and then all have ultimately showed their value once they've found their flow 
hahaha so overrated ryan sessegnon pocketed him 
next you'll all be saying ryan sessegnon is the future 🙄 
ryan sessegnon 6 i don't see it in him he's been ok at times particularly last few games but for the most part i think we've been putting up with bang average performances from him i couldn't tell you what he's good at hope he keeps improving but for now he's overrated 
ryan sessegnon 6 10 really impressive end to the season couple of bad moments earlier on but took it on the chin and improved himself one to keep an eye on 👀 
thfc ryan sessegnon vs ncfc max aarons should be an exciting matchup today 🍿 nortot coys 
drop the ryan sessegnon agenda 
who would have thought a few months ago i'd be fretting on the fitness of emerson royal and ryan sessegnon on the last day of the season 😂 
steven bergwijn i'm torn i think he should start more but who does he start over not kane son deki isn't a midfielder he's very good when he plays and i think it just sucks he's behind 3 world class players thank you for leicester though damn rating 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 
steven bergwijn 5 10 didn't play nearly enough to get a postive score unfortunately did well in every game when he did play probably best for him to leave 
yes but lucas moura steven bergwijn and jack clarke are all available 👍 
of those academy lads not on loan only mejbri and fernandez have the physical development to play at this level yet 
alvaro fernandez the best fernandez in manchester should start ahead of alex telles who is the most average left back we have ever had 
rangnick is a joke every single game has alex telles has been abysmal and yet fernandez is u23 player of the year and doesn't start what is this guy thinking one of the worst managers of last 50 years the whole world wants to see these guys it's a dead rubber play them 
jose mari former colorado rapids player is the captain for cadiz 
and 102 days before jose mari chan welcomes us to the longest christmas season in the world plays christmas in our hearts 
definitely dani alves gerard pique and jordi alba are well north of 30 eric garcia is a midfielder in a defender's body clement lenglet is a dumb error waiting to happen samuel umtiti is always injured and xavi doesn't seem to trust sergino dest 
lmfao clement lenglet is here to stay 
❗— what happened to adama traore is he really the worst see details 
thie yorr adama traore 
koeman had griezman coutinho and madafaking messi and was playing shit football xavi has ferran and adama traore 
he creates a lot of opportunities but nothing comes off them he is an english adama traore and costs 10x the amount 
send a jet to pick adama traore up asap 
adama traore should be questioned for that villarreal second goal because that was game fixing gamefixing 
any truth in depay and adama traore links 
just don't buy adama traore cost barca 2 goals tonight pedrasa a former leeds loanee might be a cheap option at left back though 
adama traore set up for failure twice by dani alves barca are never serious when alves is playing 
xavi subbed auba off and left feran torres on the pitch the irony here is that we might look for a scape goat in adama traore but the real problem is how xavi sets up his team his biases his tactics or lack of it barcelona are not going to be any diff even with new players 
adama traore is another one that was certainly a bullet dodged the hesitancy by whichever department it came from has been fully justified no way we make the top 4 with him in the side instead of kulusevski remember it's about signing the right one not just anyone thfc 
adama traore assist of the season lol 
great assist from adama traore tbf 
adama traore 🔥 great assist 🔥 
beautiful assist from adama traore 
is adama traore playing 
if you had any ball knowledge you'd realise tjis team revived cause of adama the game they thrashed athletico 4 traore would maje crosses and players would bang goals from crosses adama was in good form xavi just stopped playing him cause he doesn't luke his style of play

adama traore cannot cross if his life was on the line 
words cannot describe how incredibly predictable adama traore is😖 
now araujo doing his best adama traore impression on the wing throwing in some step overs 
steven thinks he is adama traore 
e howe wouldn't let adama traore go out on loan when champions league was in reach or send on whanga over better players on bench or take a year to find out how good toti or chiquinho is

jarrod bowen looks like a klopp player but west ham will want silly money for him saint maximin has the potential to be very good but could be another adama traore doubt newcastle would sell given their new owners either 
let's buy adama traore now we have to with dembele leaving 
really wish wolves had adama traore right now 
salah after the break konate and matip too sluggish chest pain watching and that's without adama traore 
we got a columbia adama traore 😭😭😭🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ 
currently adama traore is ranked first on the list of dribblers 😂 however he was loaned out elsewhere premiership football hard😂 mahrez silver and hazard cannot even make the top ten list premiership no get this naymar chill but if nnah no believe me i rest my case 🙌🙏 
barcelona signing adama traore on loan 😭 
mali at the afcon had at least 3 in there team there's an adama traoré at cercle brugge and barcelona too 
hey we have adama traore at hatayspor too 
adama traore i there la liga shld use him asap 
adama traore for £200m 
even adama traore who plugs 3 goals a season can do well in this league league ranked number 6🚮 
adama traore rejected pottenham despite the 4 times bigger offer 😂😂😂😂😂 
riqui puig 22 and oscar mingueza 23 are set to leave barcelona this summer according to and bbc sport paper talk both want game time thoughts 
i hope it is we don't want money minded players in the squad johan always said if u need to think twice before playing for barca we don't need you thank you for a good season dembele but now please leave and enjoy all the money u get with ur agent gracias ousmane🙏 
abeg no mind me na vex ousmane abi another dembele 😂 at real madrid 
araujó on the first place pedri is the second however here are our problems traore braithwaite umtiti lenglet puig mingueza luuk de jong dani alves ousmane dembelé pjanic griezmann memphis neto laporta's usual 2nd year cleaning job dest no frenkie nooo 
1 2 if ousmane dembélé is leaving fc barcelona and if he's willing to accept a reasonable salary then sign him because he's just unbelievable especially he's gonna work with mr pintus he would make him a beast if not riyad mahrez is also a very good option the right wing needs 
i see thank you it's a shame dembele was finally starting to show what barca payed all that money for if barca lose frenkie and ousmane it's gonna be a massive blow massive 
adios ousmane dembele in my books 
goals are not a massive issue for barca we always had players who can create ousmane did it this season messi did it for the past seasons definteily vital to replace dembele if he leaves ansu ferran auba depay can score plenty goals but for goals creativity is required 
haaland replaces lewa grealish replaces kdb sancho replaces mane or salah allison gets replaced by ousmane dembele 
ousmane dembele is better 
caps might never come but that has no bearing on joining a big club france are blessed with attacking talent olivier giroud moussa diaby anthony martial ousmane dembélé kylian mbappe karim benzema marcus thuram and jules koundé all ahead of him at the moment 
call me crazy but we should go for ousmane dembele pintus may fix his problems qith injuries and we all know how good he is when fit 
we don't have money for hospital bills so ousmane dembélé is not considered😂 
what about ousmane dembele 
ousmane dembélé is a really risky operation but not impossible if you want to — great dribbler amp wide creator but not so much of a goalscorer better suited at stretching and running at defenders mahrez remains worst option due to mileage amp age 
wide creator • ousmane dembélé • raphinha • riyad mahrez top 3 possible candidates for this role are those — and the order is correct in terms of quality per age amp benefits 
yeah but if we get rice than it would be compulsory to get a neymar or ousmane dembele upfront for that creative reinforcement 
ousmane dembele owen wijndal matthijs de ligt and a new striker of some sort i don't know much about timber but that would be 4 solid signings including de jong amp 2 good prospects 
the same league that had their teams boasting about having the world's most expensive transfers i'm talking about c ronaldo gareth bale neymar jr luis suarez ousmane dembele philipe coutinho antoine griezmann etc all bought… 
mbappe prefers playing with messi and ousmane dembele neymar can go 
definitely ousmane dembele he fits the bill perfectly considering the fact that chelsea don't create nearly enough chances he's the perfect signing cuz we'll get him for free and what's more we know for a fact he'll perform so all this i'm hearing about declan rice is shit 
didn't they say the want them saying if he had them let's be honest and i'm not hating on tuchel the only attacker he has throughly develop was ousmane dembele psg none mbappe and neymar were already there 
all football players for barcelona left memphis depay right samuel umtiti ousmane dembele clement llenglet pierre emerick aubameyang 👌🏻 
neymar out messi out and now ousmane dembele barca is finished 
our team is rebuild i'd rather we go for someone who's younger like ousmane dembele who obviously is also another injury prone player but younger that's someone we can rebuild with 
they should try and persuade ousmane dembele to join them from barca 
no not that its about that mbappe wants to replace neymar with ousmane dembele with his control 
acl injury is he ousmane dembele in disguise 
ansu fati ⚽️ four goals from just 332 minutes played ✅ xg 1 4 elite finishing 💪 improved his strength while being injured he has the movements needed to score goals now he just needs to play a consistent amount of games 
ansu fati is massively over rated not a regular starter

we would've won with a healthy ansu fati 
fuck no why would you bring a left winger we have ansu fati 
lmaoo… guy go they watch una ansu fati abeg 
just saying lads ansu fati is 134k cheaper just more time 
i have this card danjuma also but srry its feels very bad in tha game not a good card danjuma so better go for card ansu fati thats a very good card feels very good nice skill moves runs fast

ansu fati not top 3 lil bro 😹😹 real better 🐐🫡 
😂 🤣 😂 on my fm 22 ansu fati dey chop bench no where near world class just an overhyped and over expensive youngster 
are barça fans actuallly retarded clubs like city and psg always do shit like this and uefa does nothing y'all laughing now but when city comes to ansu fati with a 100m deal i want to see you laugh then 
pedri and ansu fati plays for barcelona tho

someone go find carlos bacca and tell him that it's almost time to celebrate 
valencia had a solid squad that was starving after koeman villa silva mata joaquin were all there also you're forgetting that cavani and neymar are world class players and at that time were in their absolute primes at psg ok carlos bacca but gerard moreno's in his prime 
also columbian fromla liga is finally the long awaited arrival of carlos bacca 
a young david silva villa thrived under emery at valencia carlos bacca sevilla becoming relevant because of emery danjuma gerard moreno villarreal relevant because of emery cavani neymar psg best goalscoring seasons because of emery 
actually herrera saved it sorry sergio 
jesus how in the world could they get around fifa fair play with mbappe pogba neymer and messi plus sergio ramos donnarumma herrera di maria and icardi all on their payroll 
florentino josé angel sanchez threatened to fire him last year when things were bad they used journalists close to them to do so like jorge bustos

i would actually peg cameron as the writer and robert rodriguez as the director they n a i l e d battle angel alita in both aesthetic and being so tight to the manga that it could almost have been a shot for shot while still feeling fresh

street naming celebration at ave b amp 6 st with angel rodriguez ex director i was on the bd of directors for yrs this is an extraordinary alternative to incarceration program so glad the street is co named 5 21 2022 
for centre half i'll probably go for two players i've spoken a fair bit about but robin le normand of sociedad or bremer of torino bremer's main problem is his ability to pass but he's an effective wall and would be amazing in conte's system 
alcantara family foundation is not in ghana 🇬🇭 and i ask to be a fan of the movement 
marcos llorente is also football royalty 
someone actually needs to check how many passes he even completed today because this man is as old as frenkie de jong ruben neves marcos llorente barella 
he aint gunna turn down playing with marcos llorente and koke in the champions league to play with mid table fodder shit like mcginn and douglas luiz 😂 
would love a comparison of marcos llorente's performances from last to this season noticed that some of his best attributes did come out at times at rb but it didn't consistently translate into performances and he didn't turn out to be as influential this season 
antoine griezmann carried worst atletico madrid in decade to cl quarter final 
the same league that had their teams boasting about having the world's most expensive transfers i'm talking about c ronaldo gareth bale neymar jr luis suarez ousmane dembele philipe coutinho antoine griezmann etc all bought… 
🤣 una wey sign antoine griezmann for 120m and ferran torres for 55m wtin dem dey play 
thomas lemar 
any one can win that even thomas lemar won it that year 
lol arsenal bid 90m for thomas lemar some windows ago amp nearly this amount for vlahovic in january 👀 
arsenal bid €90 for thomas lemar some seasons back 
you've only picked out a small selection of that team that have gone on to good things in the prem mendy is in prison fc barely played thomas lemar and moutinho arguably too sit down and watch ligue 1 the quality of play minus psg is behind all other top european leagues 
thomas lemar is a world champion what's your point 
we actually backed that bozo quite well levy put his foot down when he requested for idiotic signings like diego carlos but by and large we signed players for him conte only signed 2 players and of the ones that came in before him only romero was a certain starter

iñaki williams 
i have inaki williams 90 version so wondering of mbappe on 7 chem would be an upgrade 
iñaki williams 
what of williams inaki i don't know his numbers though 
inaki williams signed 9 years at athletic bilbao 
mahrez and salah are on a different planet then gnabry tbh what other signings would you make for me i'd go mahrez salah bernardo silva tchouaméni rudiger fran garcia raul de thomas no rb on the current market is worth spending money on 
🤩🤩 looks amazing 
definitely dani alves gerard pique and jordi alba are well north of 30 eric garcia is a midfielder in a defender's body clement lenglet is a dumb error waiting to happen samuel umtiti is always injured and xavi doesn't seem to trust sergino dest 
how about jorge cuenca 
would actually like tchouameni and borja mayoral bring back fran garcia and our club will be ready for next season
