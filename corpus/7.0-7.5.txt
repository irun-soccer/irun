call us bukayo saka because we let the country down 
how old was bukayo saka when he stood in as a left back for many games 3 seasons ago how old is he now how old was mbape when he took the champions league by storm in 2017 how old is haland how old is folden how old was ta arnold in 2020 
here are my season rewards pots heung min son ypots bukayo saka signing of the season luis diaz martin odegaard flop of the season nuno tavares 🗿 underrated transfer marc cucurella manger of the year eddie howe 
that's there way bukayo saka perform far better than foden 
bukayo saka he's better than mbappe anyways 👌 
bukayo saka 🌶 appearances 38 goals 11 assists 7 goals per match 0 3 minutes per goal 272 shots 97 shots on target 31 shooting accuracy 53 4 goals with right foot 1 goals with left foot 10 goals from inside the box 9 1 2 
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 bukayo saka 10 10 poty ⭐ slow start to the season but what a player played in every game of the season and was threat in almost every single one we have to tie him down to a new deal soon let's hope he can add even more goals next season special player 💫 
he's just garbage i can't be racist i love bukayo saka 
bukayo saka not winning the ypoty is quite shocking 
you booed the knee and bukayo saka didn't you 
bukayo saka 20 years old has more g amp a this season 19 than wilfried zaha 17 29 years old 
gotta be bukayo saka the guy has carried us all season 
player of the season son young player of the season bukayo saka best signing of the season christian romero manager of the season jurgen klopp worst signing of the season romelu lukaku flop of the season jack grealish breakout player of the season connor gallagher 
5 bukayo saka instead of phil foden should have been awarded the premier league's young player of the season 
bukayo saka the last time arsenal played in the ucl 😭 
bukayo saka breaks through the offside trap and into the everton penalty area an uncharacteristic show of selfishness from the arsenal youngster a he goes for goal martinelli and nketiah both unmarked in the box 🔴⚪️ 3 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
goal what an outstanding goal a very smart corner from bukayo saka finds its way to cédric soares who smashes home an unbelievable shot and surely puts the game beyond all reasonable doubt 🔴⚪️ 3 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
it's every star and it's insane bukayo saka takes studs to the shin every single game the pl seems to think head hunting is a feature of the game and it's fucking sick 
almost three after nearly giving away a goal at one end bukayo saka almost has one at the other saka manages to fend off the towering figure of jarrad branthwaite but he can 't keep his shot on target 🔴⚪️ 2 0 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
goal what a finish from eddie nketiah a fantastic cormer from bukayo saka which is flicked on by gabriel martinelli and the arsenal striker is on hand to head it home to double the home side's lead 🔴⚪️ 2 0 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
mason mount he didn't deserve it better than bukayo saka of arsenal 
arsenal should sign james madison to keep ordigard working he feels too comfortable since no one is dragging that position with him zaha should be sign too bukayo saka is too relax 
soon sakass won't remember what assna is 
for me personally i should have been bukayo saka depending on his contributions to the arsenal team not forgetting his goals and assists 
bukayo saka did better than them all 
do you know if bukayo saka plays today he'll be the youngest arsenal player to play in every single premier league game in a single season since in 2006 07 ⏪🔴 arseve 
on 1 jan 2019 saka made his debut in the premier league in a 4–1 win against fulham after coming on he became the first player born in the 21st century to play in a premier league match bukayo saka under unai emery😉 2 2 
you can't give such to this person he's playing with a senior a squad look at the teams like arsenal and liverpool on side of arsenal bukayo saka has been a key for the whole season putting a difference in every game 
bright osayi samuel 10 10 world class fenerbahçe will do very well to keep him this summer bukayo saka esque the nigerian cafu a 10 10 twitch streamer and a 10 10 footballer we love you osayi 
number of major trophies won in the last 15 years bukayo saka 1 tottenham hotspur z e r o 
6 bukayo saka 2 yrs left in his contract and he is just 20 years this dude is good like very good pacy can beat defenders easily a good finisher and versatile good defensively likes to cut in and shoot valued at €65m arsenal will be reluctant to sell their best player 
and would still be outscored by bukayo saka 
day light robbery bukayo saka had 12 epl goals and 6 assist no young player in the epl did that mason mount should be the second choice but here we are it just england thing biass and corruption 
even bukayo saka was nominated for premier league player of the year which foden was not still yet foden was given young player of the year… black 
am just asking whatif tottenham looses to norwich today whatif if we beat everton whatif bukayo saka scores a hattrick whatif we qualify for the ucl whatif i get a ticket to watch a match at emirates stadium next season whatif we win the league next season 
same to the young player of the season award they robbed bukayo saka 
saka the great i just no longer trust in the way premier league gives the awards saka bukayo shd have walked it home even tent or arnold has done great work than foden 
bukayo saka has just been more influential in an arsenal team than foden in a city team i feel atimes these awards are just about glamour and stardom 
nothing is good about this morning u guys robbed bukayo saka of epl young player of the season say no to racism 
trent alexander arnold have 15 assists this season in the league bukayo saka have more goals and more assist all the start beat pure folding start this season so hope you understand me now 
young player of the season award goes to the player under 21 here's one who is more deserving bukayo saka 11 goals 6 assists age 20 
he wasn't nominated for senior player of the season – unlike trent alexander arnold and bukayo saka so both alexander arnold and saka were considered better players than foden but worse young players whatever that means 
mr bukayo saka man shouldn't be at arsenal 
bukayo saka has played in every pl match for this season and at 20y 259d would be the second youngest to play every match in a full campaign for the gunners after cesc fabregas in 2006 07 👶 arseve 
in case they want to go vini jr l rodrigo way then they need to sign bukayo saka from arsenal a young player that will only get better though dembele fit them well 
hmm epl is now something else how is it possible i don't even understand how foden won the young player of the season ahead of mason mount and bukayo saka 😏😏 
i don't agree was the premier league guys because bukayo saka had good season done phil foden 
for god's sake even bukayo saka of arsenal stats are better than stop seeing only chelsea players please🙏🙏 
yes he is fine player but he played good football at the start of the season but bukayo saka gave our team arsenal from the start of the season to the end of the season and he managed to score 11 goals this season 
for me i no that phil foden his good player but for me i vote bukayo saka for the good job he managed to do to our team arsenal by scoring more goals this season and his our top scorer of this season and his goals are y we are in number 5 this season

also we lost to man c because martinelli missed two sitters to kill the game and gabriel got one of his yellow cards for being pushed on the referee by mahrez we lost to everton because nketiah hit the post from a yard distance at 1 1 
🇧🇷 gabriel martinelli 7 10 remember some people were saying martinelli should be loaned in january 😂 decent season but really hoping he'll explode next season like saka and esr still needs to mature a small bit but rarely wasn't a threat in most games we played 
esr saka odegaard martinelli and eddie all huge pluses gabriel and white will be an excellent partnership ramsdale looks every inch an england no1

exactly we now have esr saka martinelli eddie kt tomi benjamin gabriel thomas and xhaka seems to have mended his ways great days to be a fan 👏👏 
this is just pure nonsense saka smith rowe martinelli and odegaard managed to score more even gabriel a cb scored goals the problem isn't a lack of chances 
also i like this team a lot haven't felt a connection like this to an arsenal team for a looooong time players like saka ødegaard esr gabriel martinelli partey ramsdale tomiyasu tierney and the list goes on have won their place in my heart ❤🤍

ramsdale gabriel maybe xhaka saka ødegaard martinelli white and smith rowe are the only players in this matchday squad that regularly make the starting xi next year everyone else is a bench piece needs a loan or needs to go 
i mean oblak and sterling are world class players while ramsdale and martinelli are quite young and inexperienced they will grow even gabriel and xhaka would be average in front of ruben días and n'golo kante 
bullshit review fake positivity tavares dreadful cedric dreadful white and gabriel are very average partnership tomiyasu isn't as hype as u say he is xhaka is garbage without partey as usual saka martinelli odegaard always hide in tough moments arteta can't coach talent 
xhaka ødegaard and martinelli only good for depth… gabriel and saka are our only cl quality players 
so you're calling saka smith rowe martinelli odegaard ramsdale white gabriel etc etc bottlers with only 2 players over the age of 25 in our starting team you people are some of the weirdest ever 
you think arteta will just throw him in without injuries to either white or gabriel same arteta who played saka to the ground and never played pepe who didn't play martinelli until aubameyang left 😂😂😂 
eleny get called up for egypt every damn competition and white played in the euro's if you didn't forget same with gabriel martinelli he fucking won the olympics magahalles also so what the fuck are you saying bro 
good to hear 
we offer you nicolas pepe for gnabrys services pepe very good winger

nicolas pèpè is a goalscoring rw with good technical ability tbf if milan pick him up for less than £25million it's a great deal 
nicolas pepe for you my friend only 25 million 
aaaww you always make me smile gigaaa🥺🥺🥺happy sunday dearest ❤️ 
such raw beauty on the outside can only flow from within have a great sunday 
🦩☀️happy sunday ☀️🦩 
the nicolas pepe was a monster for lille comp on youtube 
nicolas pepe thanks for the memories hope we can raise atleast 30m from you and spend that on serge gnabry 🤌🏼🙏🏽 
emery got battered in a final 4 1 left us 5 clear of the relegation zone and bought nicolas pepe a sackable offence arteta won a trophy already 2 and yes missing out on cl is disappointing but a young team that still needs a lot of signings get behind or move on 
splashing big money on players who the manager doesn't want is how we get another nicolas pepe 
hindsight 20 20 🙄😴 there's a reason why a manager with elite talent id like jurgen klopp wanted to sign nicolas pepe for liverpool at one point good players from foreign leagues don't always hit the ground running in the premierleague i e salah amp de bruyne at chelsea 🤷🏾‍♂️ 
goal wow what a goal from arsenal a brilliant finish from martin ødegaard he gets the ball from nicolas pépé and then he just roles the ball into the far corner unbelievable finish 🔴⚪️ 5 1 🔵⚪️ afc pl afcvefc arseev coyg 
sincerely happy to met you here dear friend love exchange with you 🙏☀️📸 
threads like this are so nice hearing your description of your work let's me know i'm staring at the same thing that was made with intention not some happy accident 
how they got nicolas pepe i guess 
mbappe really hurt madrid fans sha we have reiss nelson runs like mbappe too we also have nicolas pepe at a reduced price 
so it was you who signed off on that nicolas pepe deal 
the next nicolas pepe 
they paid 72m for a certain nicolas pepe 
you like nicolas pepe sit this one out 
he not even better than nicolas pepe 
at least he is a mile better than nicolas pepe my club can't even sell him for £10 million bad market he is 
drogo you are not comparing one of the greatest players of all time in robben to nicolas pepe christ where is this conversation going 😂😂 pep and henyches made robben a monster at bayern so ofc it can be done pepe is just shit and will slink off to france or spain 😂 
yo arsenal fan stop talking about our player you buy nicolas pepe thats the end of our conversation there 
sign nicolas pepe from arsenal 
surely he has to go for nicolas pepe he can have him for 50m plus toni kroos coyg 
these agents know how to scam clubs with over priced players imagine buying nicolas pepe for £72million to be warming the bench 
nicolas pepe it's a no brainer 
hey how about we trade nicolas pepe with oshimen straight swap sounds good right i heard you need insigne replacement 
nicolas pepe no question 75 mil gets it done 
christian eriksen's return this moment in particular 
brentford acquiring christian eriksen and then playing at a premier league level after early struggles 
1️⃣3️⃣ brentford • 46pts brentford have enjoyed a brilliant first season in the top flight which has seen some great moments and some exciting football what a first pl season for frank and his brentford boys and a beautiful return to football for christian eriksen 
christian eriksen's return to top flight football 
relatively meaningless the difference in 3 points and 0 in our end of season position is anywhere from 1 15 20million a kristoffer ajer aaron hickey or a new contract for christian eriksen 
buying back christian eriksen i was adrift bottom of my league amp i would not be where i am which is mid table without him 
frank is christian eriksen still at brentford next season 
trophies in the last 5 seasons arsenal football club 2 christian eriksen 1 harry kane 0 equals career high numbers heung min son 0 tottenham hotspur football club 0 😉 not with spurs 
this from christian eriksen made me feel a bit teary 
think brentford players have upped their game too though whether it's a good example motivation different atmosphere being able to use christian eriksen's superior skills 
leeds will get beat tony goal and christian eriksen screamer 2 0 
sam greenwood vs christian eriksen a situation that sums up our season perfectly lufc 
it is unclear at this point but it is possible that christian eriksen will not be a brentford player next season 
they weren't ready for christian eriksen at stamford bridge either 😂😂 
last time out the hosts took the lead twice through mario vrancic and a serge aurier own goal but christian eriksen's free kick and harry kane's penalty saw us pick up a point under jose mourinho nortot thfc spursarmy 🎨 on ig 3 5 
2 match goals christian eriksen 1 shots amp 2 leeds cards 
if christian eriksen was one of our double 10s pulisic and havertz and even werner will score lots of goals although we need to add a creator at lwb too 
i always have you dude i said if pogba goes fdj a good replacement or neves not flipping christian eriksen

brentford have come back into this and bryan mbeumo has just missed a sitter dragging shot well wide when only had goalkeeper to beat 
38min 0 0 a cagey affair so far between two sides considering the situation at hand for leeds utd not the been the greatest of half for the bees bryan mbeumo's cheeky nutmeg on junior firpo the highlight so far

ironic considering your fans racially abused ivan toney's family last week 
and giving it the biggun for finishing 16th wilsons scored 8 in 18 ivan toney scored more blokes a tit 
the what 
what did youse say to ivan toney's ma 
that's great but we all know we won't we'll be haggling over a few million and a balon d'or clause for ivan toney on august 31st 
ermmm ask ivan toney and rico henry's family about racists 
didn't your fans racially abuse ivan toney's family last week 
ivan toney didn't 😂😂 
ivan toney 
finished 16th and has less goals than ivan toney yet tweets like he's an absolute baller pure pure comedy 
did ivan toney even play today didn't notice him 🤔😂

if they could figure out the exchange rate for league one to epl they'd be way ahead of everyone else it's not like ollie watkins and ivan toney needed testing in the championship they could have made the jump 
hope you all got on ivan toney after he was booked 😉 
ivan toney was so hyped up before the season he trolled many when he finally hauled in gw5 
as ivan toney once said fuck brentford 
brentford is obviously an interesting side due to their moneyball tendencies but the big what if of course is if ivan toney joined rbny

you're gonna sign ivan toney and think you've improved 😭😭😭 
ivan toney 
proper fan base… clearly not a nice one considering in the past week your fans racially abused ivan toney and rico henry got into scraps with vieira and zaha after pitch invading a 16th finish 😂 
ivan toney tammy abraham 
ivan toney 🔥 
omg what is wrong with me 😂😂😂 of course you do apologies in that case ivan toney feels good today i can see leeds getting desperate and leaving gaps at the back 
interested to know what you think you do about a no 9 next year cos i dont feel like the club like sensible signings much right now so they wouldnt buy an ivan toney despite the potential cos they want a 'falcao cavani' type name 
ivan toney's brentford army 
ivan toney kalvin philipps stuart dallas and maybe pukki 
ivan toney's family would disagree survival at any cost 
difficult to say as he didn't play the reverse fixture just depends on which ivan toney shows up at home to leeds🤔 think if you've got him like myself you play him but wouldn't take a 4 to get him 
i'm often a poor predictor but i did suggest before the season started why spend all that money on lukaku when you can try to tempt ivan toney from just down the road i also now think and it pains me as a big j5 fan that maybe jorginho would be better suited to italy 
ivan toney looks as if he's playing for melchester rovers 
midfielder james maddison forward ivan toney 
worth it to transfer out richarlison for a hit planning to replace him with ivan toney 
he's been my first choice since last season 2 gt tammy abraham 3 gt ivan toney 4 gt gabriel jesus 5 gt victor osimhen 6 gt martin terrier 
fingers crossed that ivan toney does the business fully expect your boys to turn us over with ease today given howe's comments 
behaved well against brentford according to ivan toney's family too 
well brentford have won 5 of their last 7 games and their players have been passing round that video of leeds taunting their manager it's on ivan toney's twitter there is as much chance as leeds beating brentford as burnely beating newcastle 
cmon ivan toney and erikson 
ivan toney 
ivan toney wasn't even at brentford at the time of the video so why would it worry him pontus own goal to keep us up as for gabby probably never paid to go watch a game in his life he would t understand banter

brentford's team news sees christian norgaard ruled out with injury with vitaly janelt starting in his absence tf's tactical set up sees him go with the 4 3 3 formation with bryan mbeumo ivan toney amp yoane wissa the trio in attack 
yoane wissa 🐝 wissais brentford's 2nd top scorer this season with 7 goals in just 11 starts and will want to increase that tally against leeds who've conceded 78 goals this season the winger has scored 2 in his last 2 games from only 3 sot showing his lethal finishing 
burnley was going down with dyche they almost saved themselves with the new manager smell likewise marsch saved leeds they were playing better by every metric yes biesla had injuries but he refused to adjust literally anything someone give illan meslier a plushie 
illan meslier should get one also made the most saves 🤣 
this is very easy to settle successful defensive plays goalie saves vastly eclipses the number of successful goal scoring attempts illan meslier leeds goal keeper has 139 saves this season salah the leading goalscorer has 22 goals 
i don't think kalvin phillips would ever join us tbf he takes the leeds and united rivalry seriously 
yeah if most are still staying at the club then i agree with that although soucek should be starting unless we managed to somehow swing a kalvin phillips 
nah hojbjerg is finished i want kalvin phillips 'cause he's overpriced and has vibes hairstyle 
i asked radz keep kalvin phillips and he said 100 
now that boubacar kamara is a done deal will villa still go in for kalvin phillips 
tchouemeni to madrid kamara to villa even the kalvin phillips they wanted so badly we can't get another summer without signing a dm for 🤡🤡🤡 
sooo about kalvin phillips… 
are we looking at kalvin phillips 
is there any chance we keep phillips next season looked like the kalvin of old in the tackle even if the distribution was a bit off at times 
you can sell kalvin phillips to us as way of thanks 
kalvin phillips is still england isn't he shame he's not at a big club oh he's going to united that's good news 
dropping 2pts against you lot i thought was gonna cost us might get to see kalvin phillips for 1 more season 🙏 
bamford's been a massive miss for you too buddy kalvin phillips too obviously 
doesn't really do it for me think we should be aiming for better personally i put kalvin phillips in a similar category no fault of their own just not inspiring imo 
buy kalvin phillips 
that's a we're selling kalvin phillips to city move isnt it 
more from marsch as he insists leeds should want and deserve more than simply 'doing it the hard way' 
is this directed at kalvin phillips 
i'd take pope over wout weghorst 😭 would rather leeds went down for that sweet kalvin phillips relegation clause tbh 
lfgggg bro now just give us raphina and kalvin phillips 
kalvin phillips taking that yellow card was probably the defining moment of that game what a player 
yes forgive my petulance straight after the final whistles but i was hoping we will get kalvin phillips for a knockdown price now we'll have to pay top dollar 
… also leeds staying up means we are more likely to avoid being tricked into signing kalvin phillips so i'm happy all round oh and donny scored 
kalvin phillips news hermano 
kalvin phillips and possibly cucurella too 
they should have gone down we'd get kalvin phillips for just 25 
they're supposedly in for kalvin phillips and frenkie de jong 
could've had kalvin phillips for 25 pain 
i think several will leave leeds i hope hope united don't go for injury prone kalvin phillips 
i like this your comment but when i see kalvin phillips nah there you fk 🤨 
i wish leeds went down we could have got kalvin phillips on the cheap 
at least leeds or everton would have been able to flog off the likes of kalvin phillips raphinha dcl and richarlison 
we are signing timber and like idk kalvin phillips 
i support west ham we just missed out on europa league but we're in the europa conference next season if rumours are true then kalvin phillips will be heading our way next season 
i hope so raphina will be on his way and i wish him well but i'd like kalvin phillips to stay please 
that safe we got money like that… kalvin phillips 
we were never signing kalvin phillips imo 
i want kalvin phillips so i want leeds down hoping for a brentford win 
burnley going leeds staying up means down no kalvin phillips 
arsenal definitely won't go for kalvin phillips lol 
i want leeds so we can go shopping there kalvin phillips x partey would slap 🙃 
think we can all agree it would be hilarious to see leeds crash out of the league then watch kalvin phillips leave after all the loyalty guff they have been shouting about 😂😂😂 
don't know mate i'm scouting kalvin phillips 
course you didn't👍 what team wouldn't want a player of kamara's quality and kalvin phillips where that come from as if you're getting him😂😂 
great reception for the leeds players as they finish their warm up kalvin phillips curls a free kick into top corner before sprinting off the pitch 
two world class midfielders watch is be tolisso on a free and kalvin phillips 
is it kalvin phillips last game if leeds get relegated 
sweating after cycling four gallon of ale back up the hill james but this should it come to pass is one of the key moves we need we will be again smashing down previous wage structures but it will still cost half of what going for kalvin phillips would 
so aston villa won't go for kalvin phillips anymore 🤔 
it's a possibility especially as his contract is in final 12 months we'll have to wait and see especially with what happens to carney chukwuemeka the added interest in kalvin phillips and development of tim iroegbunam but yes if he left this summer it wouldn't shock me 
i'm gutted by this because i think he's mint but i think kalvin phillips would be a better signing if we're looking to bring in another midfielder who offers that physicality and movement in the middle he's a better passer than kamara too imo 
yeah normal to collect cards not kalvin phillips though mate👍🏻 
kalvin phillips inbound 
we're going for de jong but don't think it will happen don't think rice kalvin phillips will happen too maybe enzo fernandes or neves will happen kamara is a easy deal to do but yeah it looks like ten hag doesn't want him so i of course back it 
so you're a chef from liverpool whos 27 and argues on twitter and you collect kalvin phillips cards i think we need contact the police to check your hard drive 
go back to collecting your kalvin phillips cards you nonce 
where does this leave kalvin phillips 
you collect kalvin phillips cards you massive nonce 
the last pre match photo we'll ever see of kalvin phillips and we've got purple shirt no smile no dimples shaking my head 
we'd much rather spend £70millon on kalvin phillips 
kalvin phillips to nufc then here we go after relegation ⚫️⚪️🤝 
spurs to win hence the arsenal win will be irrelevant city and liverpool win so no more of this unbearable quadruple talk and wouldn't be kalvin phillips available cheapish if leeds go down 
yet kalvin phillips would never refer to himself as a cult hero 
i don't mind management having a decent right hand man worked for cloughie what i wonder is what gerrard's got outside of his contacts list the idea of spending fifty million on kalvin phillips makes my teeth itch 
callum wilson kalvin phillips 
son to score anytime kalvin phillips to be carded 
i'm torn i want burnley down but i want kalvin phillips 
please just let leeds related i want kalvin phillips price to drop and also to reduce his standards by playing in the championship by in other circumstances united sign him 
villa gave you a fighting chance please win or draw and send leeds down please want kalvin phillips on the cheap in the summer 😂😂😂 
i've got my brentford shirt on ready phil we at aston villa are so so excited for kalvin phillips to join us for 25 30m he's going to go up another level playing gerrard ball with world class players like coutinho 
burnley need to pay for firing dyche but again i hate leeds fans and i need kalvin phillips and raphinha in our team leeds it is 
kalvin phillips and another cdm how many cdms you want 
just look at the teams for yourself leeds could get relegated today with the likes of raphinha and kalvin phillips on their books 
leeds to go down and us buy kalvin phillips and raphinha 😍 philips bruno paqueta in midfield raphinha maxi on the wings new forward up top poss drop a mf and play joelinton 
kalvin phillips amp jack cork yellow card son goals cancelo assist 
kalvin phillips e hector bellerin vendo isso 
kalvin phillips i suppose 
leeds really need to get relegated so we can take kalvin phillips for half the price and challenge for europe next season come on brentford 🙏 
get kalvin phillips and raphina on the cheap if they do🤷🏻‍♂️ 
wats ur thoughts on the potential signing of kalvin phillips 
kalvin phillips if they go down 
aston villa targets this summer according to john percy of telegraph are kalvin phillips yves bissouma joe gomez calvin bassey james tarkowski duje caleta car boubacar kamara matt targett morgan sanson bertrand traore anwar el ghazi 
kalvin phillips 
kalvin phillips links are too strong and hardly any kamara stuff recently this ain't happening 
1 don't like leeds 2 raphina's release clause of 25m will be activated — gt barca need to sell fdj in order to buy so we'll get fdj 3 kalvin phillips will be available for a low fee 
kalvin phillips 
kalvin phillips 
aeroelastic bassy from rangers can cover left back and centre back kalvin phillips lewis potter lingard and watkins 
chelsea havnt been seeing kalvin phillips i think he can be good dm imo 
leeds…in a heartbeat 1 because that paves the way for a discounted kalvin phillips to come to villa 2 because we all despise leeds and will forever 🤣 
kalvin phillips 
• goalkeeper alphonso areola 10m • centre back james tarkowski • left back calvin bassey 25m • central midfielder kalvin phillips 30m • attacking midfielder jesse lingard • winger tete • striker emmanuel dennis 25m • any position eddie nketiah 
no source just odd attention seeking behaviour clearly not from england therefore does not know the safety implications of kalvin phillips even talking about united let alone joining

hidden gem 💎 marc cucurella i was hyped when cucu joined the prem even more so when brighton was the team to sign him i was worried he wasn't playing as a wing back but rather as an advanced left cb in a back three but he thrived in that position averaging 8 ppg 
this guy doesn't want to go back to arsenal forget about him bring in tarkowski or marc cucurella 
that for marc cucurella 👀

always liked your commentary martin but your line on that a week ago burnley had a ridiculous penalty given against them was nonsensical the only thing 'ridiculous' about it was ashley barnes hanging his arm at a 90° angle in his own box 
also the penalty we got against burnley last week was not ridiculous as the bbc commentator said ridiculous is ashley barnes doing an impression of a fucking aeroplane in the burnley box 
oh well we have to find comfort where we can ashley barnes getting relegated is mine 
be grateful he's still on 22 goals we have forwards that make weghorst and ashley barnes look like salah and mane 
sunday league ashley barnes there is a god 😁 
ashley barnes thug football can now finally piss off 
nah man this guy is shit we need ashley barnes next season 
oh and watch ashley barnes elbow a player in each of his last two games before today and not get sent off again pundits agreed he should have had 2 red cards burnley are sneakily dirty niggling fowls that go unpunished lots of people wishing they'd go down incl some refs 
ashley barnes… oh wait… 
looks like ashley barnes was deliberately trying to sabotage them and it worked should have been sent of midweek for an elbow on mings handled the ball against tottenham too 
so happy that don't have to look at ashley barnes any more enjoy coventry and bristol city away 
ashley barnes yes grade a bell end 
ashley barnes isn't even good enough for non league football 
ashley barnes can also fo 
show me ashley barnes crying 
horrible footballer just like ashley barnes 
they showed ashley barnes looking gutted on sky sports news and it was beautiful 
leeds are staying up and burnley going down desperate bastards ashley barnes touches kids and elbows men 
ego of ronaldo but footballing ability of ashley barnes 
so ashley barnes was right 😂😂😂 
ashley barnes 👋 
all well amp good saying that now but they didn't look like changing fortunes with dyche still there they probably wouldn't have survived till the last day how things were going ashley barnes doing a dyche impression moaning about refs made me think 2day would go badly 4 them 
couldn't agree more now the likes of pope tarkowski ben mee jack cork and ashley barnes are all going to want out 
the evil ashley barnes has done is enough 👋🏾 
and ashley barnes 
my sincere commiserations to everyone at the club except ashley barnes and ben mee 
i'm happy they went because i absolutely despise that lard bucket ashley barnes 
burnley man can't believe it no more ashley barnes bullying van dijk 💔 
bye bye wee ashley barnes 
absolutely the right result that… ashley barnes sums your club up 
burnley and ashley barnes in particular make it very difficult to feel any sympathy for them here 
yes 2 goals for leeds meanwhile shocking scenes at the turf moor where ashley barnes gets arrested coming out of the tunnel for the 2nd half inappropriate relations w a goat and burnley have to play with 10 men 
why the fuck is ashley barnes starting💀💀💀 
ashley barnes brace incoming dw 
ashley barnes will be fuming bloody referees making up handball rules because they want burnley relegated 🙃 
mr burnley ashley barnes slots 
would you guys answer some quick start sit gelhardt or ashley barnes tavares or rudiger guimaraes or solly march or caicedo thanks

only ashley barnes deserves a relegation party 
ashley barnes 
ashley barnes 
this the same ashley barnes who nearly took ming's head off with the most blatant elbow this week 
the handball against ashley barnes was a clear handball again i'll ask how does that compare with other leagues 
😂😂😂 and ashley barnes up top 
this is it after 90 minutes its burnley 0 newcastle 1 brentford 0 leeds 0 then burnley equalize with a goal after a foul by ashley barnes which is var reviewed for 5 minutes but amazingly allowed meanwhile leeds are down to 9 men 
no that's been me as well it's one of those feelings that even if we won 5 0 today ashley barnes will score a 97th minute winner for burnley off his arse when he should have been serving a red card suspension for elbowing mings in the face on thursday 
if refs were anti burnley then ashley barnes would have received a number of red cards over the past few seasons the reality is that refs let them get away with murder 
ashley barnes being the one that should have been sent off against aston villa only to receive a penalty and score from it around 45 minutes into the game well sir nobody will miss you in the prem 
your cousin kirsty had never heard the 'ashley barnes baccus' song i hope she has it on repeat today utc 
if it's about the against tottenham professional ashley barnes how attempt to tackle an opponent from behind with your both arms wide open in your own box why spreading arms so wide like that 
joking aside but come on that is never a penalty and ashley barnes is spot on with what he says 
madrid will probably come in for ashley barnes if burnley go down 
penalties scored 3 harry kane 45 8' spurs v burnley richarlison 45 2' everton v brentford ashley barnes 45' burnley v aston villa 
maybe i initially read that as austrian goal machine ashley barnes for nketiah 😂 
got boxers with ashley barnes head where the crotch is lucky boxers for ashley barnes to score a hat trick in the most shithouse way 
yep compare that to ashley barnes v spurs cant understnd how was the other wasnt 
de los equipos que descendieron destaco a los siguientes como opciones para el everton norwich max aarons watford ismaila sarr burnley james tarkowski agente libre nathan collins nick pope maxwel cornet dwight mcneil wout weghorst opciones low cost con las 3b 
what do you think of maxwel cornet at burnley 
maxwel cornet maybe man that roster is dire and old 
i'd be looking at maxwel cornet can play at lb lwb lm lw and as a striker be good to have in the squad 9 goals in 25 games in a struggling burnley side 
maxwel cornet 
i'd take maxwel cornet from them ahead of taylor but we definitely need reinforcements and quality mot 
get all over maxwel cornet please sir cpfc ❤️💙

what so nufc were the only club allowed to spend in the january transfer window and by the way we've been without our main striker since december and our january signing kieran trippier since february 
1 joelinton 2 kieran trippier 3 arsenal 4 norwich 5 chris wood 
kieran trippier over the wall 🔥 
kieran trippier over the wall at the gallowgate was one of the moments that made me begin to believe we could actually do it and survive 
all na still money bruno guimaraes was key he was not cheap kieran trippier was also a handy purchase even howe would not have taken the job if he did not have assurance of being backed 
no he's not this is the same kieran trippier who said he'd never play for another premier league team 
eddie howe chris wood kieran trippier 
kieran trippier's signing the kit i'm wearing right now changed the vibe the trajectory yes it happened before the two matches i mentioned but the hope was there suddenly the season turned to magic we still took our lumps but so grateful to my mags finish 11th 
the best rb in the premier league is kieran trippier pal with krafu in 2nd 
kieran trippier own goal 
two changes for newcastle kieran trippier and jamaal lascelles replaces emil krafth and fabian schar respectively schar cleared to play after suffering a concussion on monday night is on the bench along with chris wood who's recovered from a hip injury nufc 
some nufc players may be involved for last time today but certainly no sentiment in today's team selection that's the visitors' strongest possible team after fabian schar's head injury the other night kieran trippier even makes his first start since february wood on bench 
kieran trippier makes his first start since february against his former club for what is a strong looking nufc side the other change sees jamaal lascelles the captain replace fabian schar who is on the bench after the blow to the head he took against arsenal burnew 
waiting on team news at turf moor would be a big surprise if kieran trippier doesn't start against his old club this afternoon nufc 
cesar normally i would have called you spazi but as a sign of respect cesar fuckin azpilicueta you've done me proud over the years goodluck enjoy the sun 
player cesar azpilicueta score 60 100 streaks of decent games with a couple stinkers in between didn't do much honestly is far past his best and we would be wise to move on thanks for the service though and goodluck at barcelona 
cesar azpilicueta reveals the chelsea player of the year is mason mount cfc 2 1 watfordfc chewat 
you guys are getting andreas christensen and possibly marcos alonso and cesar azpilicueta all from chelsea my club barca is in good hands dw 
saul and kenedy are starting today kai havertz mason mount and cesar azpilicueta also come in cfc chewat 
cesar azpilicueta we signed that og for 8m pounds 
could be cesar azpilicueta's final chelsea appearance thank you captain 💙 p s welcome back ben chilwell 
for cfc antonio rudiger and andreas christensen could feature in their final games for chelsea with both set to depart in the summer marcos alonso and captain cesar azpilicueta may also play their final minutes for the blues with both linked with moves to barcelona 
i can't imagine supporting chelsea without cesar azpilicueta 
best cobham talent after reece james 🐐🐐🐐 
reece james has equalled awb's trophies won this season despite missing 3 months through injury 
i hope you all are happy with your overall results for sure it was a rollercoaster of emotions shoutout to these differentials i had on its time that gave me hauls son reece james bowen bruno fernandes coutinho mahrez foden richarlison and robertson fpl fplcommunity 
next step reece james 
you ignored to comment about reece james… like you ran out of excuses by the way fikayo is a seria a champion and tammy has broken records both of em in a top 5 european league irrespective of your bias 
thiago silva and reece james captain and vice captain 
shows james levels over taa is deffo giving blows to everyone the way people are saying he is better than reece 
never seen reece' mom in any pictures in any case massive respect to her wherever she is for birthing two top players for both our men and women's teams respect to you ma james 🙏 
what does reece james have to do with it it was a stonewall red and any qualified ref will tell you so 
reece james has 13 assists in his entire pl career taa has 12 pl assists just this season pipe down 
you're youngest is a spit for reece james up the chels 
you're not getting reece james 
reece james' 2021 22 premier league 26 games 117 duels won 108 crosses 99x possession won 71 touches in opp box 48 chances created 37 shots 10 shots on target 9 big chances created 9 assists 5 goals no defender was directly involved in more goals 😉 
i hope we could just sign with tchouameni reece james and raphael leao 
reece james 8 5 10 simply outstanding he could've been player of the season if he didn't miss as many games as he did but he's been brilliant almost every time he's played most complete fullback in the world keep forever 
we need to stop converting failed wingers into fullbacks sign a specialist rb on the level of trent or reece james or etc 
always twerking for livershit physicality james🔵 goal scoring james🔵 assisting james🔵 defending james🔵 dribbling james🔵 ball control james🔵 set pieces taa🔴 crossing taa🔴 all round game james🔵 i think it's fair to say reece james is beyond clear 
reece james owns him 
reece james 
reece james is miles clear 
fake news reece james scored 5 pl goals this seaon hahaha 
livramento left cos he wanted to be a starter and realised he wasnt gonna be able to compete against reece james who's probably gonna be here for 10 years how is that chelsea's fault 
these english players get gassed up so much the only ones worth the hype is taa amp reece james and they both have champions league 🤣 
this reece james na lowkey naija boy 
reece james robbed 
only reece james 
my reece james comp on my suspended acc btw 
and we have reece james who does the same for us so why can't we have mount scoring goals and james chilwell for creativity 
reece james easily he's far more complete too 
reece james needs to be protected at all cost … what a player 
gold reece james 
80 million is for reece james 
you saying reece james is better than trent shows that you are a sentimental football fan and you are only watch the game but knows nothing about the game 
chelsea match going fanbase one of the most racist out there and always will be that fact thiago silva was barely given anytime off should tell you how vital he has been for us this season kai literally bailed us out from 100 million pound mistake reece james all 3 above mm 
reece james 😭😭 you can always dream i guess zero chance that happens 
keep on dreaming just wasting your time dreaming about things that won't happen cuz you won't see reece talk more of james 
james on the other hand is loved by all chelsea fans and the board we must be proud of the sort of player he is and support him rightfully for real reece is nowhere closer to the chelsea fpoty mount competed for best young player in the epl and he's the best performer 
playing reece james at left back to accommodate pulisic at right back i've been supporting chelsea actually going to games longer than you've been alive and i have never seen something that stupid 
you bet james 
if reece james is better than taa why has taa won far awards than him and he has won nothing since his start of his career and him and taa are the same age group taa only older with months highest with a year if you want to rate a player not with hatred and sentiment like you do 
allison reece james son ronaldo sancho manchester united 
bro reece james is so fayaaaa 🔥🔥🔥 
ur talking about future man city right back reece james 
throw a bunch of money at chelsea for reece james 
reece james 
reece james even 
rudiger reece james chilwell christensen rlc 
glad you rate reece james baller 
attack instead of passing to reece james 
am sorry that's not a picture of reece james 
ironic the only player i was dying for to come to madrid and still is is literally in ur avi reece james

captaining reece james against burnley 🤩🤩 
reece james is so unbelievablely clear of trent end of 
reece james dice 
reece james assist is always so easy like he played with confidence ehn kilofesele 
reece james is right there though i wonder why he's not the chosen one 👀👀👀 
reece james wath a baller 
not a matter of hate i like the guy but thiago silva reece james rudiger kovacic have all had better seasons 
just finished it more james reece please 
goalkeeper alisson defender reece james midfielder kdb striker salah coach klopp flop sissoko useless watford 
reece james clear of trent 
reece james no 
the pass from reece james is not well talked about 
announce reece james new contract 
reece james kovacic his decision making passing overall forward play has been better mason mount 
his style is more like reece james 
in conclusion it's fairly clear that reece james is not only an elite defender… he's also better going forward than this leabian i think we can all agree reece deserves mbappe haaland convos before him 🙌🏼 
ypoty foden won this corrupt award for contributing 9 goals all season in a manchester city attack who scored 99 goals… reece james and taa both offered more offensively to their teams than this so called generational attacker 
their g a in big league games this season phil foden liverpool ⚽️ reece james arsenal ⚽️🅰️ liverpool 🅰️ reece is clearly a better big game player 
let's start off with their g a in the premier league this season reece james 22 starts 14 g a phil foden 24 starts 14 g a reminder phil foden plays cf reece plays at wing back 
decent season not a great season you're just saying the same thing he's been average he just looks good because the rest of the attackers have been poor reece james and thiago silva are the best players in this team 
bro i started supporting chelsea during drogba days i'm only gonna add this if reece james or chillwell wasn't injured we would have been 1 or 2 on the table so they did their best for the coach we need a lot of replacement 
lukaku was literally offside😂 these chelsea fans would prolly say reece james handball wasn't a pen 
reece james is good obviously but he missed almost half of the games this season due to injury alonso was jus scoring goals sometimes he improved 
winning my mini league with reece james assist 
sell asensio jovic mariano sign lewa if possible tchoumeni sign good rb reece james will be good choice but i don't think he'll come so need to see other options 
reece james 
reece james brace 
reece james signing in gw9 got 53 points in 4 gws gw9 to gw12 🫡 
reece james rudiger or alonso were more pivotal to any success we had this season and deserved the award more they had more influence on our games were more quality in their roles and gave more consistent performances 
why are all reece james avi's trolls 😭 
we are not signing reece james 100 
just beautiful that he's coming we need another top striker ffs maybe another cm lb and reece james hopefully would be elite window still 
reece james captaincy in gw28 
reece james 
like drogba reece james hasselbaink and many many more 
perhaps because i have my own candidates for that award reece james the few times he played rudiger alonso is also there for me those 3 are better candidates for the player of season award 
maybe we're on different sides of ft cuz jorgi puli and even mendy get more criticism than mason mount especially from big accounts u can never bring up a tweet of goldberg calling out mount for his bullshit at times reece james is the real gem of cobham it's easy to see 
bringing in reece james for his goal against norwich and then brace at newcastle the week later 
he gets the most criticism as well so wys mostly unfairly as well do you see people have to defend reece james cuz he hardly gets hated by our fans 
reece james 💀💀 
has he scored more than reece james 
reece james has had a ridiculous season joint most goal involvements for a defender playing both in a back 3 and at wing back has been solid defensively and very composed on the ball getting 9 assists on an 89 pass accuracy is elite he only played 26 games starting 22 
reece james the beast next season we taking over 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿 fantastic player 
don't think reece james is even ready himself to be fully fit for the season glass 
reece james is certainly a better right back than liverpool's right back he defends better which is the primary objective of a defender and is great going forward he edges joe gomez a bit to be fair 
reece james just pure class 
reece james 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 
reece james clear of fraudnold 
warra trophy for reece james 
cobham have produced some really good defenders in the last few years can't think of one club that produces defenders this good livramento lamptey guehi tomori chalobah reece james if only they had a good process of integrating these players into the xi 
i like mount but reece james deserved this 
who the fuck buys a kit from years ago if they only started supporting them this year 
robertson 8 5 10 his standards are so high had an incredible season and not seen one person praise him 3rd most g a of a defender behind the aforementioned taa and reece james great defensively great plur 
reece james is clear 
reece james no contest 
mason mount and reece james are the worthy tangible legacies that frank lampard left for us well deserved👏 
the stats kuku speak for themselves apparently chelsea doesn't even keep much clean sheets with reece james in the team 😂😂😂 offers more what goals conceded 
reece james 
very underserved kovavic or reece james deserved it more 
nice one buh reece james and thiago deserves better 💯💯 
reece james kai havertz thiago silva robbed 
it's liverpool of course the media will get wet for trent i'm not even saying trent is bad but the fact that reece james has the same numbers as him while injured for half a season says a lot 
yes at least lampard stopped marina from selling reece james 
reece james 
if you've ever been to a game you'd know that we chant he's one of our own reece james he's one of our own' every game 
just because they are retro kits doesnt mean they have been following them for a long time lmao 
neither is madrid for reece james his dad basically said his dream is to be chelsea's future captain only reece james and mount can't be bought right now 
won't change the fact reece james is clear of palexander parnold 
of all defenders only reece james has same amount of goals 
reece james can be everything taa is i agree on kdb and hopefully mason will develop his game to be more of a passer than a runner but we have creators in other ways kai ziyech chilwell all have aspects of creativity we just need to get them the ball quicker in more space 
ahh just that reece james has equalled trent's g a for the season but missed 3 months as well nothing to worry about 
hate to say it but reece james completely lost focus and the left side was wide open aswell and mendy did a de gea and stayed on his line till the last second 
injured reece james 
who are you to say i don't rate care about reece james i've championed him for 5 years 
thoughts on that reece james assist 
player reece james score 82 100 missed a good bunch of games unfortunately personally think he could have been our player of the year had he not been injured best rightback in football and future captain 
reece james robbed 
post reece james content 
reece james actually does deserve it 
reece james is 10 times the player sadly 
critiqueing mount is fine but to say he ain't good enough is funny considering the other attackers we employ but to answer you just for the fun of it thiago silva reece james mendy and kante and mount are the only players who are 100 good enough to win the prem with imo 
reece james didn't play enough to be player of the season silva would have been a worthy winner too 
admin reece james pics please 🥺 
we want him and try to update if there anything regarding reece james 
post reece james content please 
i love the way you're making it known that reece james is an absolute beast 
this comment isn't even justified reece james in a system of finishers 
i'd give it to reece james tbh 
reece james is a million miles better than mason and actually unlike mount a life long chelsea fan yet mount is the more loved one who gets banners etc what's your explanation 
and he's talking about reece like he loves him as if he didn't call him obeece james for years 
13 jarrod bowen 14 reece james 15 wilfried zaha 16 bruno fernandes 17 jose sa 18 ivan toney 19 marc cucurella 20 diogo jota 21 leandro trossard 22 raheem sterling 23 harry kane 24 james maddison 25 adama traore 
if 5 gt 5 console log reece james else console log youre a complete imbecile 
i'm not saying u cannot write a future without him im just saying u need a 9 a pure striker and currently there is not a better option than nuñez madrid has enough money to fight for nuñez salah tchouameni and even reece james 
it doesn't get you mbappe 😂 you can also try to get reece james let us see how that works out 😂 
appreciation tweet 💙 a difficult and yet an incredible season comes to an end for reece james you are the one to lead this club 💙 perfect replacement for azpi cfc chelseafc reecejames 
i did say both of you can have your opinion i then gave reasoning for the counter argument my point is he's not a 10 but tt doesn't trust anyone else and no one else in our squad has done half the job mount does either attacking or defensively bar maybe reece james 
defensively reece james is better but for pure footballing ability trent is head and shoulders better than him 
reece madlisa gt gt gt reece james 
son and reece james 
reece james doesn't play rb at chelsea bro😂😂understand football the guy is a wing back playing in a back 5 formation 
henderson plays rb for liverpool while trent stands at the halfway line sit this one out mate reece james played cb in the ucl final 
i mean i'm basically saying goodbye to all my favourite players from home bar thiago silva reece james and mount but yeah not bottling it on the last day to you bunch of cunts was nice 😂💙 can not wait to see the bitch fit 😂 
this is why reece james gt 
where is reece james banner mf 
use the 4 2 2 2 against chelsea's 3 5 2 that will surely stop reece james 
reece james deserves it but let me mind my manchester business 
i ve always praised reece james since his debut for this club and i ve done the same for mount i love mason as much as reece but this season he has been injured a lot tbh silva deserved the trophy but i am glad for mount and i am sure james will earn it newt season 
it very much has every thing to do with race…have you ever asked yourself why chelsea main tweeter handle hardly tweet about reece james… i pray madrid come get him man he so underrated by this club 
praying tuchel makes reece james our captain 
if yall get tchoumeni and reece james for example u should be very happy 
reece james vs newcastle 
tbh silva amp reece james stood out for me but not too disappointed with the winner he was definitely in the top 3 for me 
not even close everyone knew thiago deserved it more hell even rudi kova or james to some extent mount's lucky he's fan favourite and sadly that's not bcs of his footballing ability lol cobhamsexuals chose the wrong player to be their posterboy should've been reece 
debatable but the fact that you're going for silva and rudiger in a james comparison proves how limited your argument is loool like chelsea fans don't hype up reece james they didn't want you to sign hakimi bc they were scared james wouldn't be first choice for 60 games 
reece james has been outstanding 
reece james what a season 
reece james 💥💥🚀🚀 
james arguably has a higher ceiling i love terry but he was not in the conversation for best cb in the world at 22 years old the way reece is for rb james could be our best ever 
reece james he is the only one who deserve this 
reece james isn't a defender according to tuchel 
reece james had a 3 month and still matched the best rb in the world's g a tally lol 
why is reece james' bitch ur avi 
so where is the banner for reece james 
reece james 
congrats to mount but reece james have been so consistent this season despite his injury spell deserves a shout as well 
next season's jersey numbers reece james no 2 and ben chilwell no 3 both numbers should be available 
was reece james better than mount this season yes or no interms of impact and and amount of motm 
if reece james played as many games as trent would there even be a comparison 
kevin de bruyne sturridge lukaku christensen rlc musonda tomori cho solanke reece james nearly suffered the same fate sorta until tuchel came in the only one immune from this cycle has been mason mount 
the points which got me over the line i guess came courtesy of my beloved watfordfc allowing reece james who has trolled me all season to get an fpl assist i knew the boys and their rigid defence wouldn't let me down and reece too would come good in the end 🙌 
reece james 100 
he's spot on… why didn't reece james get a banner to feel loved as mount 
in all honesty also kai's passing play was all over the place today ziyech is criminally underrated bright tonight couldve scored and wouldve deserved it so those were somewhat frustrating moments but reece james just took no prisoners he is all beast i cower at his might 
did reece james get a banner… since you wanna open that shit mount of yours 
we are looking in every direction i think the structure suits our players well not only rudiger and christensen but thiago silva our midfielders and ben chilwell and reece james 
only epl players i wana hear u tlkin too ▪︎ henng min son ▪︎ reece james ▪︎ harry kane 
reece james 
bro reece james can play multiple positions including trents own which is being the main creator and mind you he plays in a worse team than trent 
a future generational right back like reece james can't be wasting his development years at wingback and playing second fiddle to a portsmouth fan chelsea's trajectory has been downhill ever since 2017 and it's showing no signs to slowing down reece james becoming a madrid… 
i try to tell people this buh then their bias comes into play reece james gt gt gt gt arnold 
it's genuinely a privilege to have reece at the club model professional already playing at an unbelievable level and he's going to keep improving as well we would win the league with 10 reece james 
reece james too shy to be captain 
reece james could still be the best in his position tho 😪 
most goals assists by a defender in the pl for the 21 22 season ◉ 14 reece james 9 🅰️ 5 ⚽️ destined for greatness ✨🔵 
reece james at rb this guy is gonna cook the league 
crucial goal pts reece james chelsea end season 22 3 vs aston villa 3 vs southampton 3 vs newcastle 3 vs brentford 3 vs burnley total 15 
tuchel on changing his formation next season i don't see it as a problem of structure it suits our players like ben chilwell thiago silva and reece james adding he doesn't need to change it but might be forced to depending on how his squad looks cfc chewat 
one prem in 30 years 💀💀 reece james is different gravy btw 
good season must do better and hand that trophy to reece james 
reece james too 
because trent won two trophies on his head reece james a wingback in poty isn't a loser hope this helps 
thomas tuchel on changing formation next season i think the structure suits our players well not only rudiger and christensen but thiago silva our midfielders and ben chilwell and reece james via 
tuchel on changing his formation next season i don't see it as a problem of structure it suits our players like ben chilwell thiago silva and reece james adding he doesn't need to change it but might be forced to depending on how his squad looks cfc chewat 
reece james mount and bowen reece got 14 g a this season the same as trent and he wasn't even nominated for ypots disgrace

really should be reece james or thiago silva 
reece james 
reece james is the best in controlling with the chest 
reece james literally much more better player remember james under lampard look one dimensional player coming under tuchel he literally improve while mount still the same tbh 
tchouameni mane y reece james a rudiger le doy por fichado 
reece james would be my first choice😅 
reece james 2021 2022 end of season stats mind in the fact rj was out with injury for around 3 months 𝟑𝟗 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝟔 𝐆𝐨𝐚𝐥𝐬 𝟏𝟎 𝐀𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐬 
nah thiago silva and reece james deserved this ahead of mount if the club gives this award simply based on g a threat means a defender can never win and that's just wrong 
that is a 111 points difference… also i have to add that in gw 10 i sold reece james and went for chillwell instead of owning both of them… i lost a 21 pointer haul 🤣 
reece james did

reece james 
reece james 14 g a in 1000 less minutes than trent 
reece james is a cheat code 
reece james is chelsea fc best player 🤫 
ft thoughts game overshadowed by title decider and rightly so congrats to city no liverpool quadruple debates phew watford preying on sarr jogging learning bad habits from alonslow reece james is special ben 💙😍 can't wait for next season 
reece james 
reece james 
reece james

reece james is incredible man sadly has to play with duds 
another super assist by reece james✅ 
reece james assist lagi woo 
reece james said no 😭 
reece james assist ross barkley scores in stoppage time 2 1 chewat cfc 
another assist for reece james count them up 
difference is gabriel is doing it as a cb despite reece james being closer to goal the way tuchel plays him 
reece james was 30 
that's how we feel with reece james mate 
reece james still haven't shown any signs of urgency and looks quite lazy on the pitch and yes barkley is a player who isn't scared to shoot which i love about him 
reece james has 5 as well… 
reece james 
reece james has 5 goals too 
these trophies you mentioned are already in arnold's archive as small as league cup and fa cup is reece james don't have it to his name 
reece james is impossible lmao 
this is why trent gt reece james 
madrid should go for matinez at inter milan and reece james 
hmm i wouldnt say overrated would 100 take reece james over him amp taa he does the overall job whilst them both are only good in specific fields of the game 
really got compared to reece james and trent 😭 
3 players need to come now nkuku antony leão salah tchouameni reece james almost impossible tho 
reece which james the only name i see here is marcelo this is why women should stay out our sport 
thiago silva rudiger kovacic reece james all exist bro 
sneaked in reece james 😂😭 
when i told you guys you shouldn't compare cancelo to arnold and reece james 
reece james 
reece james chilwell and kova 
neymar and reece james tgt 🔥 plus he played damn well under tuchel at psg but he prob won't come tho 
i love reece james but naah 
snuck in reece james like we wouldn't notice 
buy salah for 2 3 years until better younger options come at rw sign young midfielder to complement valverde and camavinga to allow them to play to their full potential with rudiger coming a back up lb is not needed a back up rb is more necessary reece james 
kenedy raising the conversation for backup lwb next season chewat chewat havertz mount reece james saul 
snuck in reece james😂😂😂😂😂 
trent is the worst in the 3 reece james is clear of both 
use everything for reece james imo 
marcelo modric reece james 
you told me he was better than reece da goat james 
harry is the son of james hewitt who diana had an affair with it's no secret but the bodyguard trevor reece jones has never spoken about the crash or been seen or heard of since probably paid a lot of money to remain quiet or dead 
reece james clear 
tommy doyle is a good recent example imo but cucurella amp reece james are examples of how a diverse tactical education can breed great tactically diverse footballers 
admin no one cares about this update you should rather have said reece james clean sheet still intact 
that's not how you say reece james assist and mount goal 😢 
if they aint reece james standard dont deserve the fiest team simple as that they almost got relegated theres no mount tammy rlc standard there either 
nah this would destroy vinicius' career we need wingers vinicius wouldn't be able to showcase his speed if he played as a 9 remember what he did to fernandinho also mendy isn't a right back and carvajal isn't consistent they need porro or reece james if we dream big 
if i'm reece james i'm pissed 
mount has a g a per 108 minutes to foden's g a per 146 minutes so the appearances argument is nonsense even reece james a defender has a g a per 136 minutes 
that's fair but you can compare him to other rbs like reece james who has more goals in less games 
honestly didn't batter an eyelid when he went out on loan brown was much more solid as you said baffling our fans 
i think salah is the one we need with reece james and tchouameni of course we need a real backup for benzema too 
well you could have played xavier simons charlie webster lewis hall or just started loftus cheek could have also tried reece james in midfield moved azpi to wing back amp played trev rcb 
isn't reece james playing today 
reece james is better than trent 
reece james 
reece james is a defender and he has a g a every 136 minutes in the league this season lol what a joke of an award how much of that dodgy sponsorship money did city pump into pedalling this 
son felix reece james tchoumani de tomas and give more minutes to gutierrez 
context reece james is clear of pessi pessi 
all though reece james be more fitting 
rudiger 2 shots reece james 3 shots 
james reece 
reece james 
reece james is starting today good to have chillwell back too 
if you want to go on sofascore averages 2 trent 7 65 4 mount 7 42 5 reece james 7 41 18 foden 7 28 
who's feeding you football knowledge 🤣🤣 lemme see who scores out of the ones you mentioned and the guy is called reece james remember that name 
it's shit mate reece james since terry and that's it 
what was your goal posting reece james was benched joke getting into the top 10k 
better than reece james tbf 
you look like reece james' sister 
y'all are still delusional on reece james 💀 
only elite level cobham talent is reece james the rest can go 
but how do they develop into a higher standard if they don't get a few mins here and there no academy progress would have meant no john terry mason mount reece james etc 🤷‍♀️ 
reece james was injured a lot no and the other 2 i agree 
well no he didn't say the same to tino as tino is a right back and was never going to play ahead of reece james thus wanted to leave to start at another club unless you wanted us to drop reece james 
no one in the world is better than reece james 
he's our reece james pal 🤡 
endrick tchouameni reece james 
we have only mount and reece james starting 
they aren't as good as people swear they are they all aren't reece james bottom teams in the prem will still eat academy players up 
players in common how about reece james and lauren james both play football they are brother and sister you can't get much more common than that 
reece james 
imagine if someone stupid like you said we shouldn't give terry and reece james a chance at all because we are more successful without them 
reece james 
carvajal should be in the same retirement home as alves bring in reece james 💪🏽 
he genuinely has everything we want in a rb we finally have our reece james 
cavani to score reece james assist fernandinho card 
one word reece james 
umir do you think tottenham wins the title next year if they have reece james 
that's just unlucky we all see the rumours and act on them i also took reece james out very late on because he wasn't expected to start you have an excellent or so hopefully you have a very strong finish today gl🤞 
ahaha thiago silva reece james and mount all comfortably sit in there 
honestly havertz werner lukaku ziyech pulisic and hudson odoi should be ashamed of themselves that they're nowhere near mason mount's goal contribution they're barely hitting reece james numbers who is a rwb missed half the season through injury 
reece james is starting how was he right 😂 
reece james was in the championship team of the season and was wigas poty 
i must have watched a completely different player to these people 😂 there's a reason he went out on loan to fleetwood lee brown was a better player for us and most people wanted rid of him ffs 
reece james to score or assist 
ben chilwell has just done a pre match walk on to the chels pitch with reece james just like old times 
i have a starting xi which is handy reece james is a huuuuuuge worry for me went robbo instead for a guaranteed start let's goooooo 
seems like an unnecessary hit 4 in the end as reece james starts but so does martinelli so should've just started him over richa instead of doing cash to matip for 4 
i sold reece james to sessegnon for a 4 how bad is the damage 😶😶😶 
reece james 
abraham mount tomori reece james sont ukrainiens en effet 
reece james start 
man i like tuchel but giving these players a chance over youth that we can tie up for future shambles really then we wonder why we couldn't keep liveramento etc when first teamers get injured like reece james 
reece james

reece james 
tchomi and reece james nothing else 
reece james 
idc about predictions i wanna see alonso at striker and reece james in midfield

naye reece james better than trent 
sell odriozola ceballos jovic mariano get tchouameni salah mahrez bernardo for that rw dont sign porro because he will 90 be another odriozola wait for reece james i would love cr7 for 1 2 years idc if he is 37 or what not the youngsters could learn a lot from him also 
reece james 
reece james is playing his last game before he move to madrid 
it's so evident we don't have a backup for casemiro so we need tchouameni sell assensio get gnabry bernado silva at any cost that way vazquez can go back to prioritizing his game as a winger finally for a decent fullback to interchangeable with carvajal reece james 
reece james 
when he gets rested i got a feeling reece james will get it depends if we sign rice then it will go to him 
and reece james 
yeah reece james coming to madrid😅🚀 
reece james 
i find it funny you think you are getting reece james 😂😂 man is gonna snub you like mbappe did 😂 
christ alive boz look at trent since the 2018 19 season he has been putting up these crazy numbers for a defender for the past 3 seasons and now this season also reece james is only doing this for the first time in his career stop with the bias man james is class but not taa 
reece james 
reece james obviously 
what about reece james 
reece james would be a dream signing for barca 
felix nkunku antony and tchouameni and reece james i would be happy with 3 of them 
reece james

our best cb is thiago then reece james rcb rb rwb we all know you are crying for him now 
davies takes it for me and reece james rb for sure 1 assist behind trent with 1000 minutes less the greatest of all time for sure 
trent reece james hakimi 3 world class right backs 
why is everyone saying reece james when there's 0 information about him wanting out 
reece james ain't leaving chelsea pal 
nahhhh tchouameni reece james amp riyad mahrez we need pieces to make the team better salah has turned out to be selfish and is always mid after the middle of the season i e unreliable 
🤣🤣🤣 trents completed all major trophies aged 23 got numerous records that he has broken gets landed by the likes of cafu and dani alves reece james has what champs league and no records he's good but not on trents level 
reece james in midfield is pure madness kounde at rb is shite no attacking presence hudson odoi and lukaku don't make me laugh 40 yr old thiago silva at cb in a back 4 and chilwell who will most likely be half the player he used to be in a back 4 kovacic dembele good 
just buy a reece james and a world class centre back 
lmao reece james is literally way better than carvahal dfkm 
you are not getting reece james lol 
that number 5 should be james rodriguez not reece 
mount has tuchel rudiger thiago silva reece james kovacic jorginho and kante who would never concede hazard had alonso david luiz bakayoko drinkwater and lost costa in 2017 
reece james next 
he will be chelsea captain along with reece james when jorginho kante and kovacic are gone and you'll still be here crying about it 😂 it's funny how this is exactly what people said about lampard when he was a young player too so i'm not even worried 
i'd rather give it to reece james ngl 
2 0 chelsea reece james brace 
are reece james and alonso both starting 
shock ex liverpool player picks liverpool player for player of the year trent isn't even the best rb in the country reece james is better before the scouse get all offended i think trent ultimately will be a right midfielder could even see him doing a bale rb to rw 
i don't think reece james is coming this summer but i wouldn't count it out with how determined perez must be rn 
i wouldn't even be mad about mbappe if we sign him reece james and a rw that is still a very good summer 
then put in a rb in the mold of reece james 
they're getting reece james so not gonna be a bad summer for them😂 
the poor performances under tuchel only started after the recent int break 10 league games or so ago prior to that we had closed the gap to liverpool amp man city prior to that we were excellent given that we had no reece james or chilwell our forwards have been awful tho 
fichar a salah y a reece james 
reece james is english and he is at his boyhood club he can also get the best deal at chelsea he does not have a dream to play for madrid 
why can't madrid fans understand they have no chance at reece james💀 
dfc rudiger ld reece james mcd tchouameni mc ed bernardo dc suplente rdt 
on va choper trent arnold ou reece james 
i like the prospect of this happening 👌 a benzema understudy and the one for the future personally i also think tchouameni and a right back reece james are a must have this transfer window 
reece james is england number 1 as trent is very average as a defender and will be destroyed ny real madrid attackers trent is the best attacking wise yes different teams suit different abilities i hope trent doesn't play 
reece james and theo hernandez 🙏🏼 
tchouameni 100 bernardo s or gnabry i like both silva can be more versatile ganbry is younger i hope rodrygo have a historical breakthrough season like vini so… reece james is a doubt but would be fantastic otherwise jude in 2023 is a dream hopefully not a nightmare then 
darwin e reece james it would be very good for the team 
13 reece james 9 goals 
would still take reece james over taa tbvh 
1 kevin de bruyne 2 benfica's number 9 i forgot his name 3 federico chiesa 4 theo hernandez 5 reece james 
says a chelsea fan who has lost their best players to us 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the nerve to troll madrid by such a team tuerhhh🤣🤣🤣 reece james is next and there's not a damm thing you can do about it 🤣🤣🤣 
reece james mane son 
reece james 
tchouameni young casemiro regen but a better passer reece james carvajal has been making too many mistakes lewandowski if he is okay with being second fiddle to big benz then why not we need a backup st 
tchouameni nkunku bernardo silva reece james would be the perfect transfer window imo 
reece james 😂😂 y'all are so obsessed with chelsea players 
it was just the championship and relegation threatened wigan for reece james not too long ago 
tchouameni gerard moreno bernardo silva and reece james atleast 
and you think reece james will come to real madrid 
do you think kdb deserved to win pl pots ahead of salah mane reece james 
22 nkunku 23 mendy e 24 jota 25 rodri 26 aubameyang 27 rafael leao 28 thiago silva 29 reece james 30 rodrygo this is all according to the shit criteria the ballondor uses 
my dream dembele reece james gaya tchouameni it actually would not cost too much but dembele and james would be very hard to get 
reece james is probably the best rb right now 
we should sign now reece james or pedro porro and nkunku and fran garcia and yeremy pino 
i'd rather eat my own feet than have trent reece james far better 
how you gonna get reece james a boy hood chelsea fan away from them 😭 deluded 
reece james cancelo would be perfect but i doubt they fit our style 
reece james devant porro 
rw dembele dm tchouameni rb reece james st joao felix 
tchouameni reece james antony 🙏🙏 
reece james 😂😂😂😂😂 
my picks 👇 gnabry bernardo silva tchouameni reece james 
we need reece james 💯 
this year we just need reece james and pau torres 
keep reece james out of your tweets 
reece james for right back spot bernardo silva for right wing bernardo is good defensively also and has a good work rate if madrid goes for a proper winger mahrez or salah imo 
please stop the noise he is a defender and poor at it he is not doing anything extraordinary reece james does both scoring assisting and defending excellently chilwell before his injury was scoring assisting and defending extremely well alonso is just poor 
this ones better icl but i agree one of those fullbacks needs to be shipped if they get someone like reece james this team is pretty complete get rid of kimpembe if possible aswell 
thats reece james captaincy out the equation 😭 
chrck in reece james too 
reece madlisa gt gt gt reece james 
reece james 
reece james is the move 
nkunku tchoumeni reece james if he will come pau torres i think we'll be good then 
gineli reece james 
rudiger was shit even before lampard came in the system saved him tomori was player of the season at derby lampard persuaded reece james to stay if colwill wants to play premier league playing with frank is a really good option stop whining about stuffs 
ffp doesnt exist they could test the waters with a €150m bid for reece james at this point 
that's crazy but reece james still clear 
tchouameni reece james antony rdt 
i think he shall be playing reece james if he stays fit which is the better option 
why is no one talking about moussa diaby from leverkusen he's such a great player and leverkusen has that crazy rb jeremie frimpong who's been elite this season since we can't get reece james hakimi why don't we try a shocking double signing from leverkusen 
richarlison darwin gnarby mahrez reece james and tchouameni nkunku 4 out of these are needed 
reece james and chumaini is more important than mbappe we already have 3 world class forward 
we need an rb reece james the ideal option but it seems farfetched i would say an lb as well why not go all out for theo tchouameni to take some pressure of casemiro and a back up st for benzema 
what scandalous surprises have we got for next season reece james will probably be arrested for murder or something 
there are many other choices idk about salah but he's an option as a rw even tho its very unlikely he's coming reece james is kinda untouchable too so if we're realistic tchouameni should be our main target and antony is a great option imo alongside fran garcia 
option 2 • sign reece james so that we can have our rw sorted with rodrygo lucas marco •sign tchouameni must to cure the sufferings when casemiro is suspended or is on day off •sign nkunku optional to get that killer passes through mid •sign firmino as benz back up 2 2 
hi reece we don't have a home delivery service at the moment but thanks for the great suggestion we've passed that on to our team😊 james 
might be better than emerson i can agree with that but hes no reece james 
problem is leipzig wont let him go they said for 100m they would not even think about it he has a contract until 2024 so to get him this year is almost impossible the most important positions are backup for casemiro tchouameni and a world class rb like reece james 
i've got 2 options option 1 •sign a rw 1 of gnabry antony to compliment vini benz •mid tchouameni n nkunku to provide defensive n attacking cover post kcm •defence sign rb reece james or any other young rb to who'll play as a understudy to carvajal for couple of ssns 1 2 
is jovic staying 😯 nkunku can complete the new mid trio with cama valverde ceballos and he can play upfront too reece james maybe to help on the right side and st for short period cr7🤩🤩 or lewa and focus on haaland for the future 
reece james world cup pics though 🤷 and he'd probably take one of the pens 
tchouameni 70m nkunku 70 80m then either mahrez or bernardo silva preferably bernardo because younger and can play both rw and in midfield if possible get reece james aswell 
that means there will be no sosa or cucurella coming to the club chelsea will still be behind liverpool and city if we don't find food back up for chillwell and reece james who are injured most of the time 
yes sell them madrid we are coming for reece james😅😂 we have money in our bag and we are about to dismantle your team angry perez😂💔 
reece james mason mount 
now let's sign a top back up for reece james 
reece james is 100 mil minimum and not for sale 
reece james 
back up striker we can't play with mariano a rb reece james would be perfect a rw i would take mahrez tbh and tchouaméni and why not ronaldo for one last dance dreaming is free 
tchouameni reece james and any good rw gnabry or antony 
buy antony santos 70m aurelien tchouameni 65m and reece james 60m 
darwin nunez nkunku riyad mahrez bernardo silva reece james maybe we could choose 2 of these 🙄 
tchouameni reece james porro fran garcia bit meh cuz alaba and mendy will rotate dont wanna hinder his development a decent backup striker like maybe moukoko for 20 30m 
tchouameni nkunku jesus gnabry mahrez as a backup reece james thats all i want 
reece james heung min son y rdt 
i would keep jovic ngl sign a rw like gnabry or mahrez and let rodrygo develop in that position so when our main rw leaves he takes over that position midfielder tchouameni and a rb hopefully being reece james 🤲❤ 
salah or bernardo silva on the right reece james at rb 
this joker thinks he's getting reece james🤣🤣🤣it's gonna be 2027 and ur gonna have that pensioner carvajal still playing 
it should be a wow from everyone in the country but 30 odd percent of voters will still turn away close their eyes amp ears amp vote dogmatically it is so frustrating but james o'brien is right he could get away with it only time will tell 
reece james next in line 
gnabry is turning 27 in a few weeks i'd rather have nkunku antony raphinha in that order and pedro porro is a beast and is spanish too and more realistic than reece james and might even better fit 
salah mane and reece james 
see i don't care what y'all do today who y'all give games or not i don't even care if y'all lose win or draw today and i won't be watching nor checking y'all scores either but i am pleading with you start reece fucking james amd let him play till 60th minute 
i hope those stats win reece james some trophies lmao 😄 
reece james jodavid tchouameni antony 
tchoucheami or however u spell his name dembele reece james pogba for rotation and a back up st 
xav reece james for carvajal as starter tchuoameni and silva in midfield i wouldn't mind gnabry too don't know about the striker situation 
tchouameni pogba raphinha and reece james or porro we sell jovic asensio ceballos mariano and buy someone like gabriel jesus for st position 
reece james sabi sich 
salah mahrez o dembele ik it's not possible rdt or gabriel jesus as a sub for benz try for tchouchameni go all out for reece james or pedro porro 
mahrez tchouameni and reece james in asensio jovic odriozola vallejoout and lunin out with a buyback clause 
tchouameni and reece james 
de tomas for back up but i still consider ronaldo as a back up coz he has ucl experiences that maybe de tomas didn't has tchoumani for cdm back up if he wants to be bench warmer reece james for rb 
backup striker fr benz touchomani and reece james 
you're not getting reece james and sala would not be a great signing for the money he'd cost getting old and just actually not that amazing 
😂😂😂😂 reece james won't leave chelsea 
reece james fin 
1 it's have not of 2 reece james has out performed bot statistically in half the games 3 not sure awards are based solely on stats are they 
all realistic except reece james 
tchouameni reece james and a back up striker for benzema 
one of this four nkunku lewandowski darwin núñez vlahovic tchouameni ¿reece james but who knows now the final is all that really matters 
anthony e reece james 
signing that amount of galacticos would undermine our academy and block young players coming through so you might be blocking the next mason mount or reece james 
would you do wilson for richarlison and then a 4 to put in reece james 
tchouameni reece james and maybe rw 
he could be of the same potential as reece james 
that's the problem he can be better but he still sucks can't compare him to cancelo reece james and taa 
reece james first 
y'all understand this tuchel is bigger asset than any player on our roster bar reece james there is nothing else to see we are not getting such kinda manager again in near term one who is god in tactics proven winner amp has big club demeanor in media rest is just noise 
well he was a free agent and he said himself he would easily have renewed were it for the sunctions that's not the case for reece james he has a contract which might be extended after the take over it's been his dream to captain chelsea not playing for madrid like hazard 
tchouameni gnabry endrick two players i would love that won't happen are reece james and joao felix 
bernardo salah son mane tchouameni reece james 3 of them would be enough 
i get what you mean but you replied to comments that talked about who should have won the award and then u mentioned reece james and im just saying that if we put reece james there we also have to put trent there 
yeah i agree with u even though i prefer nkunku but the thing is i think we are more in the need of a right winger salah is really the perfect deal for us we also need to reinforce other areas tchouameni bernardo silva reece james… but yeah ure still right 
probably either bring wilson in for richarlison or take out cash for reece james then start him over caicedo 
seriously ffs so because nobody says this about reece james then that makes him not good enough seriously are you that fcking thick reece james is the best right back out there atm 
bring back brahim diaz tchouameni reece james and antony and it's good for me or another world class rb and rw 
gnabry porro or reece james 
reece james 
this isnt realistic but here are some players id like tchouameni joao felix reece james gnabry mahrez salah 
reece james😂 as soon as cfc has the new owner rj and mason will sign new big contracts they are going to be the face of the rebuild madrid should try build their own academy for once 
inshallah reece james leaves for us too 
well just wait too he sees reece james playing then best right back out there nobody even comes near the fella 
a rw too tchouameni and reece james or another rb 
i don't think so this season we achieved the ucl's final with a bit of chance and magic we need new cracks and confirmed players for the next season's sqaud reece james tchouameni and an right winger 
a real right wing the perfect one would be salah a replacement back up for benzema tchouameni or bernardo silva even though this is really unrealistic i would just like it reece james in defense maybe it's not impossible 
tchouameni reece james if he can go and some striker 
rudiger tchouameni bernardo silva reece james isn't possible this summer so yeah 
reece james of chelsea 
mahrez instead of salah also reece james would be fire 
forget reece james 
reece james and pulisic starts fplcommunity 
gnabry and reece james 
reece james tchoumeni bring back de thomas for €10 for st position backup 
reece james is a very good player and the high g a was him just stepping up coz the chelsea attacking front is not that solid so a player of his caliber he had to step up well maybe trent could but there or mane salah jota diaz doing that job so 
we have to learn from rudiger's mistake and renew the contracts of important players such as mason mount reece james kovacets jorginho and kante 
serge gnabry y reece james 
before u say i'm bias there were other young players saka trent rice reece james 
reece james is the best player at chelsea a blind man can see that these camps thats yal create amongst chelsea fans are messed up why is is so hard to appreciate both players who are chelsea products 
he is what reece james was after his wigan season will slot straight in and become our best defender 
if reece james doesn't start would you do james to robbo and salah to mane for a 4 even if salah starts or just the simple move to sess or alonso 
is reece james a joke to you 
rudiger reece james chalobah mount 
plus reece james 
salah tchou reece james 
dm backup tchouameni rb reece james st backup gabriel jesus maybe 
reece james is a class footballer 
theo hernandez reece james cristiano bellingham 
then there's reece james now 
you're not touching reece james 
reece james doesn't make any sense the club trusts carvajal vazquez and for future they signed tobias even nacho can play there which club keeps 5 rb's lmao the conversation for rb is finished the guy was ready to play for free when chelsea was in problem 
enters reece james 
last season i asked for reece james to do better in attack instead of sharing output with wan bissaka and always playing it safe like kyle walker and they came this season to twist my tweet as i said bissaka is better than james 
anthony tchomeni reece james would be really tough after cfc are losing 3 defenders already and maybe another young talent like a camavinga vini for the future 
and how can phil foden get the premier league young player of the year where there was trent arnold reece james gallaghar mount saka 
reece james and tchouameni gnabry 
bernardo silva tchouameni reece james and a backup striker 
you don't get 😂 we can attract other european and outside european based players for sure but not reece james i don't see him leaving chelsea 
people call mount our best player you can take that as reece slander i simply said james was more talented and better captain material they're not my sons ffs i'm allowed to think one is better than the other 
we can't get reece james sadly 
should just offer reece james a new contract and include an insane release clause the kdb and salah saga at chelsea pains me till today 
he wrote reece james reading well is not your thing 
gnabry and reece james 
tchouameni reece james marhez and rdt as back up for benzema and we're good 
reece james 
reece james 💀💀 
reece james all day everyday 
get a rw tchouameni and reece james thats money gone to great use 
tchou nkunku and reece james and we are fine 
reece james 🔵🔴🔵 
towards reece james we need a rb no words can describe this player reece is a menace lastly nunez as a center forward we need him he's more or less versatile too ancelotti can rotate between him and benzema i dont know what to feel about mahrez or salah tho😂 
reece james is a must 
go ahead invest the following rw salah hazard bale out ss foden nkuku mariano out cmf tchounami rb reece james odriozola sale lb cucarella marcelo retired cb pau torres then label mbappe enemyofmadrid 
forget reece james g 
i would honestly go for reece james and nkunku 
james reece 
reece james 😂😂😂😂😂😂 
with a more attscking rb rodrygo's output may increase to 15 25 goals more games for valvedere amp camavinga will also free up rodrygo to stay in e box more reece james hakimi poro nkunku will also be great if he can operate in rotation with rodrygo on e right side 
james reece i wish to know you physically because i love 💕😘 you so much 
son mount reece james 
the fact that you think mount has deciples proves my point you were the same people who where calling him franks son why cant you compare reece to arnold instead of constanty talking bad about chelsea players along with our rivals you're a plastic btw i love james he's our best 
reece james is not a realistic buy😅😅 pedro porro is a more realistic buy tchaoumeni pedro porro and one of nkunku or darwin nunez is what we should aim for 
son and maybe reece james at rb 
reece james clear 
yes still tchouameni costs 70m next year we need a modric replacement which will cost another 100m reece james type fullbacks cost another 80m atleast plus a forward to that now barca bought coutinho griezmann all by your logic no point burning money like that lol 
choumaini and reece james now that's a good summer screw mbappe we already have a world class forwards 
salah reece james and tchaoumeni and we good to go 
reece james performance in this game was unbelievable one of the best i've seen 
3 pogba unsettled at united and wants to win trophies 4 reece james madrid needs a rb and rj is the best rb right now 5 mahrez i would love to see him play for rm 6 jude bellingham maybe not now but after a couple of seasons 
son nkuku gnabry either of the three and one more midfielder like tchouameni reece james rb 
you should be talking about how reece james a defender is on that list 
serge gnabry reece james 
kylie walker must be playing tennis and reece james must be a football fan 
he just a system player is the benchmark to every rightback no rightback is bee compared to reece james 
man said reece james 
when you look in terms of stats it's criminal how him n de bruyne won the awards reece james has more goals and assist than foden and he's a full back😂 salah has double the assist and more goals than kbd and he's been average since afcon 
klopp and reece james was my dream i didn't think he would sign an extension if there is one signing i would make its klopp 
reece james is too old for the award no 
just sign antony and our rw problem is solved no overrated players like salah mane still considerable but he will play lw hence benching vini antony tchouameni and reece james and we are done for this season 
i'm sick of the narrative that trent can't defend the attention is usually brought to his crosses and playmaking but he's still an amazing defender stop the delusion that reece james is better 
havertz reece james and mbappe 
reece james 
never trust reece james lol 
at least 200mil vini for reece james 
i'll sign salah and reece james at any cost 
tchouameni and reece james would actually help the team more than mbappe but james is pretty much impossible 
for me lewandowski tchouaméni reece james and mahrez or gnabry is better option 
how's reece james realistic 😂 
reece james sir 
reece james also will never win the world cup tho or the euros 
reece james… 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 
right that's when we lost chilwell for the year reece james for a big chunk and were decimated by covid for a while losing our wb's killed our attack since everything runs through them in tt's setup 
tchouamenie reece james 
it's a me former navy seal james reece 
for rw one of mahrez salah gnabry midfield tchouameni defender rudiger signed need rb reece james preferably 
reece james y rdt 
reece james 
reece james

let me help you guys out👇🏾 son chiesa nkunku tchoumeni reece james buy all of them 
now we can get darwin nuñez serge gnabry and reece james 🙌🏾 
reece james 
reece james 
reece james touchameni 
reece james seems promising enough for rb he was seen so determined while playing and did a wonderful job to shut and pocket vini 😍 
mahrez tchouameni and reece james would be a w window 
salah trent jarod bowen mount robertson harvey barnes pogba michail antonio jesus reece james kane kulusevski what do all these players have in common they all have more assists than kevin de bruyne 
lmao never getting reece james 
reece james never going to happen 😂 
funny looking reece james since when has he had a sh t barnet … 
reece james dream on 😂 
salah trent jarod bowen mount robertson harvey barnes pogba michail antonio jesus reece james kane kulusevski what do all these players have in common they all have more assists than kevin de bruyne 
you aren't getting reece james 
you have got to be delusional to think salah is a more realistic buy over gnabry or reece james 
salah trent jarod bowen mount robertson harvey barnes pogba michail antonio jesus reece james kane kulusevski all of them have more assists than kevin de bruyne stats aren't everything but for a creative mid assists are important 
there is literally no way trent is better defensively than reece it's a huge myth that trent is a bad defender but when you lot try compare him to james defensively it's just baffling😂 
madrid fans still talking about reece james lmao you guys just got rejected fgs 😂 by two worldies 😂💔 traumatizing i know 😂 
it's one of the reasons i'm not impressed with the pursuit of hickey seems like a nice chap but i shudder when i imagine him against diaz zaha saint maximan they will bully the shit out of him we need physical specimens at full back like reece james 
we have to learn from rudiger's mistake and renew the contracts of important players such as mason mount reece james kovacets jorginho and kante 
madrid should just sign either gnabry or mahrez to reinforce the attack sign tchourmeni reece james and fran garcia and we're already favorite to win next seasons champions league again na the farmer go still continue to farm all his life vinicius for ballondor next season

i think people misconstrue his shyness with the capability to be a leader and he has been a captain for wigan 
reece james tchouameni gnabry rdt 
boy b nen deh si mahrez ak reece james but i doubt chelsea will even entertain any talks lol b daaal hana rodrygo step up kom vini next season 😭 
kanté 6 5 10 n'golo just has to do better next season if he stays not good enough this season and needs to work on his passing and decision making abilities i would definitely keep him for another season tho stay 
for me n'golo kante should be on it the guy is a legend man💙 
another concern lowkey is n'golo kanté have a look at his fitness by league games played 19 20 22 38 20 21 30 38 21 22 26 38 you look at chelsea and i don't look at anyone who is undisputed to start at liverpool or city which is poor after the money spent 
as an example n'golo kante has been as important to chelsea as any of their forwards in recent years but his stats won't tell you that his performances do 
or last season when glen kamara was n'golo kante 
and u said something about underdog well n golo kante carried a relegation fodder to their first ever pl title gerrard played in far superior team than leicester city what's his excuse 💀💀💀 
is the n'golo kante of dj's the most kind down to earth n loving human being 
i mean oblak and sterling are world class players while ramsdale and martinelli are quite young and inexperienced they will grow even gabriel and xhaka would be average in front of ruben días and n'golo kante 
could i please get the n'golo kanté cars from the unboxing video i am a dyhard kanté dan and this would mean the world for me if you see this and you are not danny pls retweet this and tag him in the comments🙏🙏🙏🙏 
you are 💯 wrong with n'golo kante the rest yes especially alonso whom i will organise party when he leaves 
i'm sure you wish it was n'golo kante neh😂😂 
what's the over under on how much jasmyne spencer just ran 40miles she makes n'golo kanté look like a slacker 
mansour's billions can't buy the ucl where was your legend kdb when you needed him the most in last year's final overshadowed by n'golo kante or aguero who said he will only leave after city win ucl ' 
hehe this man played a whole season with daniel bachmann in his squad and still won minileagues impressive 
hassane kamara… can't think of any others tbh 
watford goalkeeper ben foster will make his final appearance for the club while hassane kamara and william troost ekong could return to the backline highly rated youngster kwadwo baah may finally make his debut for watford with an outing off the substitutes' bench 
james cleverley and pritti patel made cosy links with tpuk and calvin robinson tom harwood grimes etc pushed the conservative party this is just round two 
and on his educational experience i was at the training ground a few weeks after masina joined and sat next to him on a sofa while he waited for an english lesson all he had for a text book was lonely planet's guide to kent good luck adam i hope you can fully enjoy rye now 
literally aha most of the players we've bought dont join us as world class players but become world class from coaching look at the team my man took over big simon mignolet injury prone sturridge nathaniel clyne top 5 cb in the world lovren 
is there any chance can get joachim andersen back for next season ffc 
remember when joel ward scored a ot winner in the playoffs 
still better than weve got joel ward on the riiiiight 
this is the same website that showered joel ward with racist abuse for scoring a game winning goal in the playoffs it's hardly a far fetched claim here 
i need to sign joel ward asap 
yes reboot the destroyer rip fred ward rip joel grey 
who boos joel ward wow 
when jets fans booed evander kane i said obviously he has earned this at this point with this fan base in particular' when jets fans booed pk i said well he loves a good slew foot and is pretty polarizing' when jets fans booed joel ward i just said fuck '

that's how i see it can't rely on bamford would love conor gallagher as a 8 but think he will be too much ££but would love him think we need another top cb as well 
amongst others but i cannot possibly fit them into one tweet conor gallagher levi colwill are on the list too 
should be looking at renato sanches cm tonali cm tchouameni dm for midfield positions that's if they're serious for next season asides kante conor gallagher amp kovacic every midfielder should be up for sale at the club 
conor gallagher conor fucking gallagher💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀not to mention declan rice wtf it's clearly biased towards english princesses the prem can't stand the fact that their best players aren't english and they never have been will be 
he's no conor gallagher 
conor gallagher is the answer as is spending money on defenders you better hope you win the cl final then or your season will have been massively hyped up just to win 2 trophies on penalties against a chelsea side that can't score goals 😂 
no offence to the bloke but conor gallagher over sonny 🤣🤣🤣🤣 do me a favour 
nah sell him because conor gallagher is who we need 
how was conor gallagher 
conor gallagher was shortlisted over him i'm not sure what conor gallagher is better at than son besides being english it sure as hell isn't football 
he needs to be paired with gallagher so he can sit in midfield and preserve his legs conor will do the running and get grooming first hand 
conor gallagher is better 
and conor gallagher's the fifth 
yep i'm a city fan and it's a strange one only one or two outstanding games in the league great winner against atletico in cl but my vote conor gallagher never gonna happen pl at its worst salah 
as an arsenal fan i think conor gallagher 
conor gallagher too you lot love to hype up our youth until we're linked with a player you don't like and then the narrative changes and the youth isn't good enough which it isn't btw 
he'd be fantastic back up for conor gallagher 👍 
first away game in a while absolute scenes from a conor gallagher double 
no ben he wasn't conor gallagher crystal palace mohamed salah liverpool trent alexander arnold liverpool kevin de bruyne manchester city phil foden manchester city declan rice west ham 
conor gallagher declan rice foden no son any wonder we feel there is an agenda 
suss arsenal fans don't understand the concept of loaning out players for development never seen chelsea fans moaning about conor gallagher in palace when kante is shitting whenever called upon or kovacic or jorginho being out of the team 
conor gallagher should of won shame we will never see him again as he rots in chelsea reserves next season 
mohamed salah robbed ke mason mount robbed kevin de bruyne is d worthy winner and dere is no argument abt dat foden is also worthy even conor gallagher did better than that ur mount did dont mind d confused boy o jare good morning to you too 
he said it like a 100 times he wanted brendan aronson but the board couldn't get him he wanted conor gallagher the board couldn't get him he wanted lewis o brien the board couldn't get him 
source phil hay reported it all last summer conor gallagher was 1 target we waited a month to be rejected by him then scouted lewis o'brien late in the window made at least one offer 
has to be masons hatrick and meeting conor gallagher 
scott mctominay diogo dalot victor lindelöf alex telles i don't want to see them next season 
when life gives you alex be fergusson not telles 
parcelo isn't even clear of alex telles 
alex telles 3 5 10 sold a dream on telles much like dalot with proposed good crossing ability… absolutely shocking much more defensively fragile than shaw makes the question to why williams did not just remain shaw's understudy 
last season luke shaw said the same alex telles was bought to fill his place 😂 
i'd still pick the old over this shameless alex telles i doubt if alex is a brazilian to start with 
1 in 3 out antony joins from ajax for 75 million a fellow brazilian alex telles leaves for 23 million maguire and wan bisakka leave for 35 million each 
how did you no its alex telles the whole team are messed up 
scott mctominay diogo dalot victor lindelöf alex telles i don't want to see them next season 
i have never ever thought alex telles was premier league top 6 quality 
not only alex telles but the whole squad they played shitty football as usual 
alex telles scott mcshit we've been in the trenches bro 
overrated alex telles is better than him 
alex telles is zero i don't know why some fans like him 
10 alex telles played more down to shaws form and injuries but he never looked like a first team player for us likely to be sold 3 10 
alex telles on his way out now aswell 
we got maguire mctominay alex telles phil jones please stop talking 
alex telles should be the worst player that we've ever signed such an abysmal show throughout the season 
alex telles may be meeting his end imo 
how did you know it was particularly with alex telles 
alex telles is not as good as advertised i wonder how he got at united some people were just born lucky in the past on best of the best found their way to united nowadays we have telles bissaka maguire jones etc enjoying life at united how did we get here 
don't think it's all him though players have been fucking awful think alex telles couldnt pass a ball today 
he doesn't actually need this game to order the sale of alex telles 😌 
alex telles is a fraud no surprise can't get anything right he wouldn't be able to smell the grass in on the pitch if not for shaw's injury woes 
ur right alex telles 
alex telles should be released immediately 
he told you he was particularly unimpressed with alex telles just now 
how on earth did you got to know it's because of alex telles is the reason he is shaking his head 
baba alex telles is playing well 
you can have alex telles mate we will take cancelo off your hands good swap deal that 👍🏻👍🏻👌🏻👌🏻 
alex telles was decent 
sam pilger is an oracle he particularly saw ten hag look only at alex telles and not anyone else 
how did you know he is particularly not impress with alex telles and not lindelof or bruno 
alex telles is the worst left back in epl 
who told you is only alex telles😭😭 
alex telles makes ashley young look like prime evra 
how did you know he's shaking his head for alex telles but not dalot 
erik ten hag has been shaking his head a lot in the stands and not been happy particularly unimpressed with alex telles 
no one's ever been impressed by alex telles 
alex telles is finished 
top reds are sick i'm willing to give alex telles 8 years to prove himself if they think likes of shaw rashford and mctominay deserves a chance under ten hag 
alex telles beautiful game auto comps at 25 i'll do 20 shipped 
alvaro fernandez the best fernandez in manchester should start ahead of alex telles who is the most average left back we have ever had 
alex telles in any team 
stop playing alex telles he is so awful 
rangnick is a joke every single game has alex telles has been abysmal and yet fernandez is u23 player of the year and doesn't start what is this guy thinking one of the worst managers of last 50 years the whole world wants to see these guys it's a dead rubber play them 
🚨 new via alex telles seems to have his days counted' with the impending arrival of erik ten hag the defence is likely to be one of the areas most affected mufc 🔴 manutd 
and alex telles still looks out of place 
i'd keep juan mata and rather get rid of alex telles juan mata is always a great plan b 
alex telles stay 
scott mctominay 3 5 10 if he did not come through the academy he would be no where near this united midfield much more suited to a box to box player in a less possession oriented side quality of passing is atrocious and goes hiding 
but it's ok for us to play scott mctominay che adams and lyndon dykes he played for ireland since he was 14 
lmao another scott mctominay 
great ralf deserve that tbh he rated maguire and scott mctominay that says a lot about him 
wish i'd have a chance to boo scott mctominay at sami ofer 
scott mctominay part 2 all passion no skill 
scott mctominay diogo dalot victor lindelöf alex telles i don't want to see them next season 
imagine scott mctominay play cool today while i'm only waiting for him to book just a card i'm really disappointed with my team today mostly rangnick 
get rid of scott mctominay absolutely useless these lot mata cavani and matic can't cope anymore so time to offload them too i want to see transfer news of a united clearout 
12 scott mctominay divides opinions…my opinion is he's proven again why he's not good enough all bark and no bite kinda player and his performances have shown that 3 10 
scott mctominay 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 
absolutely abysmal season rrs been a disaster honestly is there a worse midfielder in the league than scott mctominay every time he plays we loose the midfield and yet ragnick picks him every game keep playing crap players and you keep getting crap results good riddens 
it's almost like we didn't play with a midfielder scott mctominay is the worst midfielder in the league i'm not even excited about next season because these crap players will still be here 
this is propaganda scott mctominay was the worst 
scott mctominay is rubbish a free header and straight to the goal keeper hope ten hag is watching this mcfred pair is shit 
with scott passion mctominay in our midfield how dare you sir 
do you want scott mctominay 13 mil 
how is scott mctominay a midfielder can't pass for sh t and no positional awareness 
bruno is the worst player to ever play for united scott mctominay close second 
scott mctominay needs his easy goals 
we have scott mctominay why worry 
how has scott mctominay played so many games 
man utd are shocking mate and we got erik in the stands today scott mctominay maguire bruno all playing like poo no ronaldo or sanchez either 
he's watching scott mctominay of course he isn't 
he will be in pain just after 10 minutes of watching harry maguire and scott mctominay 
time to watch scott mctominay make 42 fouls 
harry maguire and scott mctominay do we want ten hag to leave before he even joins 
i'm trying to be extremely positive about today's game but i just know everything will be ruined by scott mctominay who's gonna spend 90 minutes jogging around fouling everyone who's better than him and losing the ball 10000 times 
i looked in your pond … didn't see anything worth netting … only the southern scott mctominay at a push 😂😂😂 
he don't wanna play in midfield with scott mctominay next british media folks will be calling rubbish 
dalot scott mctominay lindelof and fernandes 
scott mckenna gets in your team easy as fuck as does tierney robertson patterson mctominay gordon mcginn gilmour mcgregor adams dykes and majority of our bench bale would be the only player id take from u 
timber knows that the media and fans will scapegoat him for united's failure while scott mctominay and rashford gonna start every week without any responsibility now darren fletcher is even more powerful than earlier this means mctominay is untouchable 
but if you're going off of passion to depend on whether a player is good or no scott mctominay is world class he's the most passionate player in the world with championship ability like hendo 
hahahaha hard work and passion that means scott mctominay is the best footballer in the world 
not defending him at all just stating the obvious he was very bad but scott mctominay is the worst off them all 
who brought up scott mctominay and he was brought in by jose and won trophies 
funny how a team stacked with players with trophies ronaldo de gea varane have still haven't won a trophy this season but you just attack bruno to suit your agenda if he was at another club that won trophies you'd be spamming pictures of him compared to scott mctominay 
maguire scott mctominay bruno none off them were ever mentioned mf 
first of all fofana and saliba aren't clones so just because fofana did it doesn't mean saliba would second of all fofana played next to the most expiernced cb in the league jonny evans 
i would personally see tarkowski more as a jonny evans replacement 
he has to go the transfer policy of going cheap and only for youth has to go jonny evans type player has to be bought perhaps tarkowski from burnley but need leaders and a bit of experience this time next year will be bad unless things change in a major way 
aye would of been nice to see him or henderson there was great to see reidy and quinny there as well as loads of other ex players jonny evans was there as well was on loan twice years ago his brother is our captain 
ngl fofana played with jonny evans most experienced cb in the league saliba would be playing with gabriel that would literally be the youngest cb partnership in the league and probably in europe's top 5 leagues

harvey barnes

yeah i am thinking of bringing him too the good thing about spurs is if son scores points kane is highly likely to score some too my greatest worry is kdb who i don't have and can't have kane and kdb both can diaz harvey barnes cover kdb barnes is on fire right now 
i understand the maddison move and it is the sensible move but personally i see more upside with harvey barnes owing to southampton's high line and zonal weakness good luck rey 
harvey barnes has the same amount of league goals in the toughest league in the world as pepsi dog

we also need a manager that will start stuart armstrong more 
let me guess should be a shortlist of stuart armstrong john mcginn andy robertson kenny mclean david weir archie gemmill and susan boyle 
also as prone as saintsfc fans are to unfairly slagging off eg ralph and redmond they also massively overrate certain players stuart armstrong didn't manage a single assist in the pl this season 
yes should of also put the under 18s as a positive in this tweet too fantastic season for them 👏 the likes of salisu romeu moi stuart armstrong and broja had a few good games too but all too inconsistent saintsfc 
stuart armstrong overrated too many injuries and doesn't score or assist nearly enough 
kwp tino perraud jwp stuart armstrong che salisu 
79 come on   saintsfc slams home the spot kick after stuart armstrong was tripped 2 1 
that was stuart armstrong not adam i wouldn't sell stu as although he's been disappointing this season he's consistently been one of our best players since he joined 
midfielders won't leave ibrahima diallo stuart armstrong will smallbone unlikely to leave james ward prowse 50 50 oriol romeu likely to leave nathan redmond saintsfc 
if we was to sell bruno who would we get richarlison pritchard james ward prowse raphina frenkie de jong 
goal of the season and james ward prowse freekick vs wolves doesn't even make the top 10 list 😂😂 ffs have a day off 
james ward prowse saintsfc poor opening 7 games came back from suspension and carried our squad for the rest of the season 4 brilliant freekicks and we are well and truly fucked if he goes saved us against brighton and leeds as well 8 10

raul jimenez deserves a better team 
wolves striker raul jimenez misses a massive chance against liverpool goalkeeper alisson wolves have to score those chances livwol premierleague mancity have pulled one back against astonvilla they need two more goals if liverpool wins as well 
what raul jimenez has doneeee 
i said we need a striker like raul jimenez with the same player profils for besiktas

raul jimenez fucked us up badly 
neto and raul jimenez kits 
raul jimenez is scoring a hat trick 
raul jimenez is a ball playing cf like lewandowski and kane many don't really notice because he plays for a lesser club he will make a huge impact if chelsea consider signing him and he has been in the epl for so many years now 
i'd go for de ligt koulibaly fofana and raul jimenez 
madrid now in looks to sign raul jimenez 👀🇲🇽the wolf 👀better than mbappe at finishing anyways 
people who have football knowledge will get this he would suit us so well last year i wanted us to sign gerard moreno raul jimenez is a similar type of striker i would honestly take jimenez yea he's dropped of a little but honestly he would have no pressure smart signing 
raul jimenez 
he's worse than raul jimenez

we should sign claudinho he is an brazilian baller that plays for zenit he is unbelievable him chiquinho pedro neto and podence in good form a striker that can score 10 goals a season we might compete for top 5 
8 pedro neto neto is confident on either foot which makes him hugely unpredictable meaning he can play and shoot in a variety of different position the 20 year old is fleet footed and likes to weave between defenders with quick hip movements also encouraging sharp changes 
it is too early to say moro and romero had 26 appearances between them in a season romero also had good things to say about sarri as well inzaghi gave opportunities to strakosha and cataldi but pedro neto also had 4 appearances in a season 
and is it better to wait some more days until all leagues open then the price of joao cancelo is even more down than now 
thanks bro but which one be better for me i want joao cancelo only not other 
i'm following cristiano since 2005 imo the nations leafue is bigger than the wc because ronaldo won it the wc is tinpot farmer's cup only for superteams ronaldo can't carry such finisged players as ruben dias bernardo silva and joao cancelo 
i am so confused about joao cancelo cards this toty card has pace sb thats why i like this but others are 94 rated so i am but confused please suggest brother 
can you please show me joao cancelo stats at this level 
mate what klopp spends alot but he makes smarter signings he turns smaller players into stars pep needs oil money and buys players like haaland joao cancelo sterling and them lot 
wasn't in the pitch invasion i just am joão cancelo 
gk alisson def joao cancelo midfielder kdb striker son coach conte flop rashford useless club manchester united e no go better for that club😡 
goalkeeper of the season david de gea defender of the season joao cancelo midfielder of the season son striker of the season mo salah coach of the season thomas tuchel flop of the season player grealish useless club of the season arsenal 
captaining joao cancelo against newcastle in the first half of the season 
trent cant defend to save his life he should have just been a winger same as joao cancelo kyle walker is the name you are looking for 
joao cancelo 6 good start to the season not gonna speak about the 2nd half 🤡 
you ever heard you look like man city defender joao cancelo lol 
please note that joao cancelo rodri and gabriel jesus are not game winners in such instances they are game neutralizers they should stop shooting and starting passing 
shut up mf joão cancelo has been better than foden tell foden to score against top team not relegating side 
joao cancelo 7 10 he started the season putting in 9 10 performances every week until about january business end of the season he's been very unreliable imo lucky to be getting a 7 with him playing benzema onside for the goal against madrid 
watkins to score or assist joao cancelo to be carded 
just do the eye test between both joao and trent and you can see cancelo makes fewer mistakes than trent does but in terms of attack i would pick trent in a heart beat 
the 2005 picture looks exactly like joão cancelo 
john stones earns 250 000 weekly and joao cancelo 80 000 weekly

riyad mahrez bottler himself playing with a team of bottlers🤝 
if riyad mahrez had scored the penalty city would already be champions 
how can you start with fernandinho while you got zinchenko and even walker on the bench and sub riyad mahrez i really don't see it coming mancity epl premierleague pepguardiola liverpoolfc 
riyad mahrez he might been approached 
riyad mahrez or gabriel jesus who can play both right wing as well as a center forward 
faysal says he wants florentino perez to sign riyad mahrez since it will be a perfect fit with karim benzema and vinicius jr in that front line adding mahrez that would be a dream front 3 for the galacticos 
wide creator • ousmane dembélé • raphinha • riyad mahrez top 3 possible candidates for this role are those — and the order is correct in terms of quality per age amp benefits 
nahhhh tchouameni reece james amp riyad mahrez we need pieces to make the team better salah has turned out to be selfish and is always mid after the middle of the season i e unreliable 
riyad mahrez sa serait un trio incroyable 
nobody talks about riyad mahrez 
to me this is pretty easy mo salah vicious is already thriving on the left wing benzema remains a key player from the striker position there's only one position to be filled right wing and that's exactly where salah plays my alternative option would be riyad mahrez 
riyad mahrez 7 10 decent numbers amp decent performances performances have faded off since february but the numbers are still good 
first assist riyad mahrez final score 3 0 
riyad mahrez is the best😏🔥 
first assist riyad mahrez 🤞🏿 ft city 4 1 villa 
darwin nunez nkunku riyad mahrez bernardo silva reece james maybe we could choose 2 of these 🙄 
riyad mahrez this season — gt 33 g a in all comp — gt best goals per 90 in the prem — gt man city's top scorer in all comp — gt broke agüero's record for most goals in a single ucl campaign stfu kid 
riyad mahrez first assist jesus to score 
riyad mahrez he's pretty good 
when errors become part of a professional then something seems to be wrong maduka's error cost us the afcon exit against tunisia daniel akapyi did same with riyad mahrez free kick at afcon francis uzoho did same against argentina at the world cup in russia and ghana in abuja 
the best players want to play in the champions league you guys ll have to recreate the miracle that leicester performed remember they had ngolo kante amp riyad mahrez in that super team unearth your gems arsenal it can be done 
penalties awarded 4 spurs v burnley man city v west ham everton v brentford burnley v aston villa penalties missed 1 riyad mahrez 86' man city v west ham

raheem sterling 5 10 been on the decline ever since 19 20 the numbers may be decent but the performances are not i'd like to see him with a striker next to him massive improvement needed next season 
md 35 newcastle h 10 10 another perfect performance from the boys 5 0 win again now making it 17 goals in 4 games and 1 conceded making our goal difference that much better than liverpool's a brace from raheem sterling and 3 goals in his last 3 for rodri too

how do you fuck up that badly like who let raheem sterling onto the team 
kdb and haaland transitions against defenders like michael keane johnny evans dan burn virgil van dijk and calum chambers 
so does calum chambers 
drug test calum chambers this guy is not human 
wolves have scored already the quadruple challenge really is on now 10 mins in city are looking fresh and strong at home to villa villa lined up well then i saw ex saint calum chambers was playing🤔the easiest £16m we ever received city will see it through liam g said 👨‍⚖️ 
on top of that calum chambers amp tyrone mings 
calum chambers has joined dortmund for £10m thanks for the goal vs leeds and the pass vs southampton lad 💙💜 
mings and calum chambers i'd actually fancy myself to score 
you've done alreet but your nee lucas digne 🤣😘

goal matty cash assist lucas digne 
lucas digne acilen liverpool transferi 
what a cross lucas digne 
another great call from lucas digne 🥰🟣🔵 
introducing lucas digne imagine poetry 
was a manoeuvred deal to get lucas digne to villa feel for the lad in the whole situation to be honest 
everyone hype gerrard here coutinho there but forgot lucas digne do an own goal 
coutinho for 20m and greatly reduced wages swiftly adding lucas digne before everton made a managerial change now boubacar kamara a 22 year old french u21 international on a free gerrard has plenty to work out on the pitch but he operates in a different personnel tier 
just like the really successful signing lucas digne 
interesting that you decided to omit the fact that we sold lucas digne when talking about how we afforded patterson and mykolenko… 
welcome mate if you want to be able to relate to the rest of the fplcommunity as quickly as possible i recommend triple captaining lucas digne today let us know how it goes 
don't forget a lucas digne masterclass performance in defense 💀 
left back but lucas digne 
why does your article mention everton selling lucas digne really poor from you i expected better 
italians and french have names that sound good federico chiesa leonardo bonucci nicola barrela roberto mancini hugo lloris and lucas digne these are some football players though 
or a slight twist to the tale and maybe lucas digne gets the winner 😉🤣

lucas moura substitution was turning point for son 
i mean instead of bringing on nketiah laca lucas moura bergwijn elanga from the sub bench etc it's better if it's isak that's coming on 
there are far more important things in the world but i will join in tonight's football tweets and ask what the hell are the criteria you use for these is salah at watford or lucas moura really not as good as mane's workmanlike short range diversion or xhaka's perfunctory shot 
gotta be subbing off lucas moura 
thoughts on the lucas moura assist 
lucas moura the classic coysocysocysocys guy passion exudes from him he's always working always running and prior to conte was basically the only player with off ball movement but like stevie i think his fault is only just being behind kane son deki rating 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 
if that twat lucas moura or whats his name hadn't scores in the 95th minute in 2019 we'd have also won the cl final if if… 
do you know who lucas moura is 
lucas moura assist today 
could barry have set up son's first as well as lucas moura did up there with ethan pinnock's strike in the goal of the season discussion 😂😂 
lucas moura owns amsterdam 
lucas moura likes play 😂😂🤣🤣 
he got the same amount as lucas moura jesus fucking christ 😭😭😭 
true they let lucas moura score a hat trick 🤣🤣 
i'm lucas moura 
lucas moura is a whole mood 
everyone needs a lucas moura in there life look at him loving life 🤣 
you forgot nuno for subbing off lucas moura 
bergwijn debated constantly ajax interested 20 million backup striker lucas moura getting older ability drop off 10 million regulion not up to standard good ability but can't provide 25 million gollini failed loan 
in the words of lucas moura coys coys coys coys coys coys coys coys coys coys 
lucas moura 7 after years of being bad under mourinho lucas has put up a very good season overall looking creative and sharp on the dribble and has won us multiple games sadly still very overhated by our fans but i've grown to appreciate him despite being inconsistent 
lucas moura 2 10 at his best he can't string 2 good performances together to save his life trampoline first touch harmful to the team majority of the time 
all praises to lucas moura for the assist 
you can have lucas moura 
lucas moura fan club 😎 
love you son and and lucas moura those people who criticized lucas for not passing the ball to son can go to hell how dare you put wedge between the two 
lucas moura btw 
lucas moura heard me 
and lucas moura 
nah he got postered by lucas fucking moura 😭😭 
thfc make just one change from their win at home to burnley dejan kulusevski comes in at right wing for lucas moura harry kane does start despite previous rumours about illness nortot premierleague 
what a night lucas moura gave us in the netherlands that night will always be with me 
upgrading to son's tots and swapping benrahma for a ww lucas moura would be ideal 
yes i agree lucas moura's goal was a banger 
yes but lucas moura steven bergwijn and jack clarke are all available 👍 
harry winks and lucas moura 
if bench players are also selected on impact i don't think dinho would even make the bench tbh matuidi and lucas moura would both have stronger claims than him di maria pauleta and pastore off the bench tho 👀 
ruben duarte is a very good lb this is the kind of profile i like still high defensive probability yet also decent passing game and finishing probability especially getting these stats in a weak team is good rv for alaves €2 007 250 creativity probability 49 correct 
which ruben duarte got a couple of hits in wyscout 
what about ruben duarte last player for the next few hours have to go d 
here is my suggestion for the nat to win the division the lineup is ok ruiz in 2 don't take ruiz and y hernandez out the lineup at the same time dfa escobar n bring luis act ss and ross dfa voth or to minor six man rotation corbin 3 and sanchez 6 used elpino 5 7 innings 
personally i would try to sign alvaro negredo 
got the 🇭🇳 anthony lozano goal to keep cadiz up as well

ronald araujo is the only one that for me 100 stays and is undisputed starter material

ronald araujo shot and u4 5 goals 
barca turned on the sprinklers on an opposite team that was celebrating a qualification at camp nou jordi alba busquets are some of the biggest cheaters around and to say so many girls look up to her as if she had eaten a ball boy for a ball thrown seriously 
you're not going to like it but our player of the season was probably jordi alba 😭 
i don't know if it's new but here i go i've lear's that jordi alba is the worst lb at defending in the world 
this is good until jordi alba entered in 
jordi alba is the worse of the lot can't cross as a full back wasted runs nothing productive gavi is jus hype no forward pass no key pass just young and hype 
back with busquets and jordi alba i don't think so 
just look at jordi alba 
jordi alba has a foot fetish 
my money is on jordi alba 
definitely dani alves gerard pique and jordi alba are well north of 30 eric garcia is a midfielder in a defender's body clement lenglet is a dumb error waiting to happen samuel umtiti is always injured and xavi doesn't seem to trust sergino dest 
ferran is playing more of 11 jordi alba is playing more of 11 gavi is playing more of 11 xavi doesn't understand why goals don't come anymore 
we're screwed with jordi alba and dani alves as our full backs in the ucl 
we're screwed with jordi alba and dani alves as our full backs in the ucl 
we're screwed with jordi alba and dani alves as our full backs in the ucl 
and jordi alba too players with no imagination 
the guy literally tweeted we back after beating us 4 0 lacks class it's between him and jordi alba 
sound's like jordi alba type 
dont have that but i have a picture of jordi alba with barcelona's we won 4 0 trophy this season🤩 
someone like you would say robertson is better than jordi alba 😂 
that jordi alba can hop into my team 
i hate xevi worst coach i ever seen in my life sergeo b or jordi alba are useless in the club now 
any jordi alba sbc news 
hahaha just searched by jordi alba and it's one of the first gifs that appeared lol 
barcelona should've went for this guy jordi alba cannot defend anymore 
jordi alba 🏟427 games played for barça 🏷world class left back for 10 years and counting 💰bought for 15m ⚽️46 g a in 3 seasons 🧹47 clean sheets in 3 season 💭 who 
jordi alba even has more trophies than chelsea 
the only tireless runners in that 11 were dani alves and jordi alba abeg nobody else was a runner they won by pure class and tactical brilliance 
didn't barca fans booed jordi alba roberto who scored in your biggest comeback and also dembele before he made comeback this year hell there were bashing lewandowski last year as he was about to win ballon dor ahead of messi but this year they are licking his ass as he is coming 
the fact that he mentioned jordi alba just goes to show how much messi was fluid messi was barca tiki taka conductor he liked up with the whole team not the rb so messi has no one to use as a comparison in this conversation 
any news on jordi alba sbc 
true but at the time there was not a financial fair play to be there only for some teams but not for others barcelona cannot even renew jordi alba but psg can have 200m in losses and 700m in wages 
the easiest thing to do is to buy frenkie de jong konrad laimer ruben neves amp bring back james garner into the fold add bruno amp van de beek to that 4 then you have a good midfield 6 capable of doing things mcfred have to go asap 🚮 
from barcelona spain in a frenkie de jong barcelona fc jersey 
oh sorry i'm not talking about ferran i'm talking about frenkie de jong 
if we was to sell bruno who would we get richarlison pritchard james ward prowse raphina frenkie de jong 
frenkie de jong should be sold even if its only for 70mil 
neves de jong would be a terrible midfield frenkie needs a quick and strong dm not a slow weak low block bruno 
araujó on the first place pedri is the second however here are our problems traore braithwaite umtiti lenglet puig mingueza luuk de jong dani alves ousmane dembelé pjanic griezmann memphis neto laporta's usual 2nd year cleaning job dest no frenkie nooo 
back with out frenkie de jong will be a joy to watch 
awful end bad season just keep frenkie de jong and don't sell him 😡 
xavi is working on the team it's evident game play is good but frenkie de jong is shit sell him asap if possible 
frenkie de jong needs to leave 
frenkie de jong is a fraud man i hate his game sell him already 
midfield box of gavi pedri kessie de jong wide wingers wide cbs no wing backs kessie and frenkie would cover those spaces 
we need 2 midfielders of a high quality a striker a centre half and a full back frenkie de jong is one of the few options we can actually get and is world class £60m for him is a bargain and wouldn't annihilate our budget 
🚨🇳🇱 frenkie de jong and jurrien timber to mufc are both done deals 🔴✔️ deals won't be announced until eth and the clubs are ready for it 🔜 eth will be unveiled tomorrow as manchester united manager interview at 10 and presser at 12pm 
a little harsh i think frenkie de jong is a bigger problem for me

frenkie de jong is minus one in that midfield no chance creation zero creativity slow passes very weak and absurd positioning if you look closely at that goal he has part of the blame too 
why are you letting go of frenkie de jong 
frenkie de jong is not an untalented footballer and if he couldn't take the duties of reviving this midfield soler wouldn't either downgrade for sure 
frenkie de jong from barcelona i watch barca's games is not much of an upgrade 
memphis derapper ousmoney dembele and frenkie de jong 
what happened to frenkie de jong 
wait till frenkie de jong turns up at utd in a few months both of them will be different gravey nxt season 
frenkie de jong's last match for barca 
is he frenkie de jong's replacement 
bro what happened with frenkie de jong 
mr president is it true that you wants to sign renato sanchez tchouameni and frenkie de jong 
what happened to frenkie de jong 
we want nunez or nkunku add antony from ajax midfield frenkie de jong 
frenkie de jong our future leader frenkienosetoca 
if they can bring frenkie de jong into the side that'll be huge for the club 
i do care only for frenkie de jong 
announce frenkie de jong 
they're supposedly in for kalvin phillips and frenkie de jong 
erik ten hag thinks he can persuade frenkie de jong to come more talks with him and his agent next week to try and get them on board with the project of what he wants to build barcelona will consider only high proposals 
yves bissouma denzel dumfries frenkie de jong ngolo kante lamptey anthony if the bank balance isn't at a negative don't stop buying 
announce marquinhos frenkie de jong aaron hickey william saliba gabriel jesus etc 
i have a feeling that the frenkie de jong deal yes i'm serious 😂 is going to advance quickly because imo he was waiting to find out if we had secured uel football or not 
«john how fast can we secure frenkie de jong and timber » 
now watch how fast frenkie de jong deal develops he wanted for us to confirm uel football 
you guys can already say goodbye to frenkie tonight there is absolutely no way to finance 50 55m for raphinha 40m for lewandowski 30 40m for koulibaly … without selling de jong ah and on top we also have to offset the 600m loss from the last 12 24 months 🙂🔫

someone actually needs to check how many passes he even completed today because this man is as old as frenkie de jong ruben neves marcos llorente barella

🚨 mbappe want to sign both renato sanches and frenkie de jong this summer mbappe dreams of playing alongside de jong 
frenkie de jong doesn't want to play conference league 
lol so much for signing frenkie de jong 
whoever fabricated this statement is dreaming of playing frenkie de jong with mbappe 
agree mate i think trn hag will have a good idea who and what we need i can see timber happening and i would love frenkie de jong tbh hopefully we move quickly in the window 
they says frenkie de jong removed name barcelona from his bio is that true 😅 mufc 
non top 6 clubs got kamara and guimares man a dumb club about to give barcelona 80m for dumb frenkie de jong 
only midfielder i can safely predict that is on the list is frenkie de jong other than that i have no idea 
check this one 🚨🚨 frenkie de jong dreams of playing with kylian mbappé 🥇 🤣🤣 next will be mbappe is playing a big role in the signing of frankie 
frenkie de jong a 25 year old dreams of playing alongside mbappe 23 i guess anything can be made up to sound like news these days 🙄 
frenkie de jong should go to psg even though they will never succeed in the champions league it would be interesting to see him along with pogba 
with pogba going to juve i'm worried psg might go in for frenkie de jong ffs 😭 
lmao no ask me foolish question plis i wan watch frenkie de jong last barca game 
sell frenkie de jong but renewing this bum barcelona is a joke and catalan tax bias is fckin real unbelievable 
frenkie de jong and donny van de beek questions tomorrow 👀🤣🤣🤣🤣 
just to let you know i watched a lot of frenkie de jong and you bought a player to replace busi and he is still player 
messi has never chased bags if you got sense you would see barca is trying to do the same thing to frenkie de jong it's not about the players wanting more it's the club 
is the next frenkie de jong 
🔃 reports coming from frenkie de jong said goodbye to barcelona fans today mufc 🔴 manutd 
🚨 news by frenkie de jong might possibly be the future of manchester united mufc 🔴 manutd 
🚨 new via frenkie de jong has already had three conversations with erik ten hag mufc 🔴 manutd 
bro lisandro martinez to manchester united antony santos to manchester united frenkie de jong to manchester united edson alvarez to manchester united and any other manchester united transfer news 
in a league where sancho earns £350k wk ddg £375k varane £340k sterling £300k and you think halaand going to city on £375k is for the money frenkie de jong and de ligt earn €300k like how much were u expecting halaand to earn he'd even earn more in some other big clubs 
so you think it's worth the risk on both i've spent so long scouting fbref for a statistical profile that arsenal need in the lcm and cf lcm best i've seen is frenkie de jong cf still looking incredibly hard to hit all the needs 
looking to bring in a top class player under 25 to fulfil this role if we do get frenkie de jong this may change slightly as he can likely fulfil the role of taking the ball off the cb's but will need help in anchoring the midfield physically likely coming from a… 
what actually happened barca fans thanks for the signature frenkie frenkie de jong my pleasure take care goodbye barca fans take care goodbye 
for example frenkie de jong is from willem ll's academy🤷🏿‍♂️ 
what about frenkie de jong is he gonna leave barcelona as well？👀 
any updates for frenkie de jong 
idek what to say anymore… actually i do warra frenkie de jong for you 
let me guess and tell you something de jong manchester united and ten hag continue to push for frenkie de jong the player is waiting to see if mufc qualifies for the europa league or conference league as player would reject chance to play in conference league there you go 
bought kounde and honestly araujo was better gave me that varane feel can now bench varane with someone similar that ain't a rat hopefully a frenkie de jong sbc i need a cm dm matthaus is so shit 
please sign frenkie de jong for us 
announce frenkie de jong 
frenkie de jong might possibly be the future of manchester united mufc via 🔴🇳🇱 
well it's obviously not done but it's clear he's more attainable then that of a frenkie de jong or antony 
it will only work if a young sergio busquets comes as well 
you truly said it in that statement pep guardiola finally found his sergio busquets' replacement 
he developed talent in barcelona messi wasn't the person he was when pep took over he also brought in sergio busquets pedro pique wasn't who he was when he was w manu thiago alcantara kimmich also iniesta and xavi revolutionized their game thanks to peps tactics 
sergio busquets the last piece of the holy trinity along with xavi and andres iniesta best defensive midfielder of all time busi is summed up perfectly by this quote if you watch the whole game you won't see busquets—but watch busquets and you will see the whole game 
i'm also good but i'm underrated just like sergio busquets and di maria😔 
sergio busquets is better than zinedine zidane 
its a utter myth he inherited a winning barca side we were in disarray pep came in promoted a certain sergio busquets got rid of ronaldinho which took huge guts to do an changed everything about the club 
why frankie d jong want to leave barcelona i thought he might be the barca mixing machine like sergio busquets my question is that who will replace busquets after his retirement 
im seeing sergio busquets and marquinhos in this comp scary kid 
and going toney over nketiah made my 8 useless i would've gained 1 otherwise since matip did his job beautifully lost 2k today and finished 45k🌍 not happy not sad i just think of all the errors i made throughout the season like taking ferran torres the gw he had a 🎩 
it was so funny in the stream when everyone was saying ferran torres in the chat 😂 
as if we will agree to £40 million 55 at least you spent 55 mil on ferran torres and rapha is 3 times the player of him 
we won't of you keep playing ferran torres even disasterclass after disasterclass 
i've stopped blaming him and turned my attention to xavi he needs to explain the playing time he's giving to ferran torres 😠 😡 or is he a fraud 
hw3 obi nso🙄 ship out all those average players they're not barca standard 1 baby oil man 2 ferran torres … 
ferran torres should be awarded player of the season 🙄 
he was repeatedly told he was not worth been signed what else were u expecting imagine him treated like ferran torres 
frank de jong is overrated still can't believe we paid 50 for ferran torres alba needs competition 
your view on ferran torres 
luuk is better than ferran torres i will miss him 🥹 
and also wtf is his obsession with ferran torres he shouldnt be starting all game 
ferran torres gt fati and i am not even trolling here except finishing fati got absolutely nothing over ferran 
looks like don't worry you have ferran torres to save you 
renewing roberto and signing ferran torres and christensen just proves it we need someone like tuchel or klopp stop hunting for the next zidane we don't have him 
ferran torres vs villareal highlights valencia where it started🔥🔥🔥 
no we won't get the treble when we are starting bums like ferran torres every week 
ferran torres was an absolute terrible signing 
waiting for your ferran torres highlights 
ferran torres is not a barca level player 
correct those 4 are the only barça level players i know we are f cked financially but our standard isn't ferran torres aubamyang and traore 
no one is worse than ferran torres 
this barcelona ain't ready no rhythm quality dynamic they r all playing w o thought 2gv d fans something to cheer on n close d season aside araujo d rest r just useless on d pitch most notably ferran torres i wonder how we spent £50m on dz no good player xavi ofcoz mr spain 
get this bum ferran torres out of my club 
this barcelona ain't ready no rhythm quality dynamic they r all playing w o thought 2gv d fans something to cheer on n close d season aside araujo d rest r just useless on d pitch most notably ferran torres i wonder how we spent £50m on dz no good player xavi ofcoz mr spain 
lmao ferran torres owns xavi 
just clocked ferran torres might get a medal 
king ferran torres 
yes same ferran torres 
we all know ferran torres do not deserve to play 
na same ferran torres 😂😂🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭 
y'all just look for every opportunity to drag ferran torres to be honest he's not playing badly tonight but agenda must agend sha 👍 
ferran torres is one big issue then xavi decided to add adama that will run from ibadan to ojuelegba then cross ball to lekki 😩 it's as though xavi will never have sense 
please how on earth did barca sign ferran torres for 60mill what is special about him i am sure there is some mistake this is totally unacceptable and its scam luke dejong abde jutgla and braithwaite will upper 3x what ferran uppers 
araujo has more dribbles today than ferran torres has since joining barca 
i still don't know what barcelona saw in ferran torres 
my question is what did barcelona see in ferran torres 
ferran torres is overrated he keeps disappointing me he's not productive at all no single take on by him as barca's winger i just barca is not depending on him for next season 
no way araujo has more dribbles today than ferran torres has since joining barca 😓😭😭😭😭 
god ferran torres is bad🤣🤣🤣 
if xavi continues to favour torres in the front barca will hardly score any goals this season and next season this ferran torres is no where near barca level someone tell xavi this fact pleeeeeeeeeeeze 
xavi will lose his job at barcelona due to ferran torres 
ferran torres is so bad 🤡🤡🤡 
ferran torres out motherfuckers 
we still have ferran torres 🤦‍♂️ he's horrible at this sport 
but what club has a squad of ferran torres auba gavi etc and wins anything you have to pay to play 
with ferran torres and eric garcia as the future you're right 
are stuck with ferran torres sigh 
ferran torres seems on point and also think frenkie looks like a man trying to prove that he does know how to function in this team then there's araujo who looks like he thinks we're liverpool and can win the league by winning this game 
ferran torres is no good for our club tbh for a while now he hasn't shown any attacking power or creativity and he skill level is just poor 
if ferran torres and aubameyang are our main attackers we are winning 0 trophies there is no character in that frontline we have dembele and fati but one is leaving and other has fitness issue we need lewa more than he needs us 
ferran torres for isco 
barely loses the ball and ferran torres in the same sentence don't do that bro 
you really think ferran torres is a barca level starter 😪a squad player we need dynamic wingers on the right side raphinha is more important than lewandowski 
ferran torres is always in the starting eleven and it won't help him in any way because he's burned out 
fc ferran torres 
lol ferran torres and adama start no need then 
if i can survive ferran torres at 1 30 then monday toh nikal hi jayega 💅 
ferran torres ou memphis 
why can't we play ferran torres on the right with abde as an alternative 
we can play ferran torres on the right with abde as a substitute ansu lewa ferran 
how did xavi manage to start ferran torres in this game again😢😢 take a breather boss you could use a weaker 11 and give other players a chance to feature at least in the last league game of season i'm not implying ferran is part of the stronger 11😅 
ferran torres again ffs 
when will ferran torres ever be bench 
xavi and his boyfriend ferran torres again 🤦🏿‍♂️ 
ferran torres out 
there's a few things in this world that are guarantees 1 taxes 2 death 3 ferran torres starting 
same no way ima watch ferran torres play football 
at this point xavi is forcing it on ferran torres 
memphis on the bench for ferran torres it's not fair 
it's like xavi is c d with using ferran torres this guy should be on the bench watching he added nothing valuable to the team since he's been bought 
tv will only be turned on after ferran torres leaves the pitch 
every time ferran torres 🤦 is it that xavi isn't seeing what we're seeing for the last 3 or 4 games he's been struggling 
i'm sick of this ferran torres midpack already 
god ferran torres again i'm f cking tired of this sh t 
must ferran torres always start it's not even funny again 
city had the most expensive squad but after they sold ferran torres united have taken over meanwhile man utd may have the most expensive squad but city got more quality in the squad than man utd 
ferran torres ffs 
ferran torres 8 because he is spanish ridiculous player 
ferran torres scored bunch of goals for man city in the premier league this season before he was sold in january city started the season as the most expensive so what happened along the line in january doesn't mean they man united had the most expensive squad all through 
ferran torres won trophy chill mancity tax 
does ferran torres get an epl winners medal 
we can use ferran torres in rw his natural position 
please sell ferran torres and keep dembele else barca will drop to earopa 
we will only win if ferran torres is benched 
ferran torres with a hat trick 
ferran torres hat trick incoming ⚽️⚽️⚽️ 
ferran torres should be give a medal too 
does ferran torres get a medal 
sell ferran torres 
we literally have to dembele is gone and adama is gone if we dont were literally stuck with ferran torres 
50 millions for him will be a fair price considering how much barcelona paid for ferran torres 
hes bigger than ferran torres 
ferran torres right winger next season 
nope it's atlético not getting the job done ferran torres left city for barça lewandowski basically handed in a transfer request the figures for the mbappe thing is another level of financing camavinga chose madrid over psg transfers are different atléti just don't have it 
that was ferran torres and he's more of a winger then a striker 
ferran torres on the right 
ferran torres plays basket ball 
and how did they get ferran torres and ake and de bruyne john stones ederson laporte walker use your head and stop cherry picking logic 
mingueza dest ferran torres frankie luck ter stegen i memphis depay 
they aren't the only ones we've been hearing that barca has a 1billion something debt and cannot sign players yet they bought ferran torres for 50mil they are signing players on free contracts and paying them improved salaries heck they're even going for robert lewandowski rn 
do swap deal with ferran torres 
boo bro not ferran torres i'm sick of this player he plays boring football whenever you're winger or center forward you have to absolutely clinical at finishing the chances 
lol ferran torres rejected madrid 4 times 😂😂 
dembele is unbelievably clear of ferran torres don't let your pain over him leaving make you lie to yourself 
yes dembele should go so we can see ferran torres and collado on the wing next season 🔥🔥 with azpi and roberto as the fullbacks for the right back position 
to be honest the ferran torres signing doesn't look too good now 
memphis and de jong are way more important than ferran torres and roberto btw 
ferran torres runing down the wing then sadly 
coleworld this does it for me you are as st0pid as they come only city fans believe they got haaland for ferran torres money you payed the agency €40mill you payed his father €40mill and his wage is x4 minimum of what ferran had 
i don't get the obsession of getting that many spanish players barca are only interested in alonso because he's spanish the same with ferran torres if he was from england barca wouldn't have bought average at best 
but the total amount was like 200 million including agent fees and everything the ferran torres money wasn't able to pay all of that 
yet he's one of the untouchables getting 90 minutes almost every game we will see next season but so far ferran torres is a massive budget busting bust by xavi 
city bought haaland with the ferran torres money but it's ruining football 
if ffp and uefa don't move they could also take ferran torres after de jong and dembelé 
united is not more expensive than man city you are capping it was on january 9th that man united became the most expensive squad because man city sold ferran torres why did you contradict yourself in same tweet what does your last line means are you confused 😂 
md 3 arsenal h 9 5 10 back 2 back 5 0 home wins a brace from ferran torres and a thunderbolt from rodri a near perfect performance but still missed a lot of chances 
it was on january 9th that man united became the most expensive squad because man city sold ferran torres you are correct bro man city started the season as the most expensive squad if ronaldo played in man city squad they would be in the champions league finals 
united is not more expensive than man city you are capping man city defense alone cost as much as pogba sancho sterling fee grealish fee mahrez fee it was on january 9th that man united became the most expensive squad because man city sold ferran torres 
lol yeah…… for ferran torres 
ferran torres told me he wanted to leave i told him the door is open' these were pep's words at the time please don't tell me ferran is not mbappe he was a great talent and pep could've taken advantage of him 
what about your starboy ferran torres 
but all of them dey champions league final now but the ferran torres carry u go europa dem still remove una 🤣🤣 u no get shame 
read these articles to understand what i'm talking about barcelona has pedro's release clause set to €1b how does setting a release clause stop you from keeping the player please just say something else 
ferran torres den adama seff make u ppl chop 4 na lewandowski den raphinha u go chop am woto woto 
you reject good players to buy bums like coutinho dembulla and ferran torres what are you waffling about 
ferran torres was one 
we will happily let kids like ferran torres and leroy sane walk we'll net the profit and move on to the next signing 
🤣 una wey sign antoine griezmann for 120m and ferran torres for 55m wtin dem dey play 
please let us get kalvin philips from leeds marc cucurela from w albion and pau torres from villarreal to add to the squad🥺🥺 lots of love ❤️❤️ and congratulations once again champions 
1️⃣ pau torres 2️⃣ tchouaméni 3️⃣ kessié 4️⃣ bellingham 5️⃣ pas besoin 
we will try we have other signings on board of pau torres frank kessie christensen and the rumour of returning neymar 
make no mistake top four should be the aim next season but it will be tricky to replace pau torres if he does go as expected either way emery will be asked to prove himself in la liga next season having already done brilliantly in europe 
negotiation with napoli president is pain in the ass ffs we gonna end up with pau torres 
timber for me pau torres is another version of lindelof 
now let's watch de jong and pau torres 
dembele darwin nunez pau torres koulibaly kounde will do for a start 
you think we can get pau torres 
mate when you speak to paratici next time tell him we want lautaro pau torres amp kostic 👍 coys 
sell the project to them and it should work we've got ucl so we can finally get players like pau torres with minimal issue 
pau torres need a top cb to be competing also a better striker 😂 
plz get two centre backs pau torres timber so imp you get maguire lindelof jones plz get yourselves sold need kante tchoumeni kamara in the midfield antony on the wings 
pau torres alone is worth 70 mil 😂😂😂😂 
bring kounde tchouameni perisic nkunku gvardiol pau torres and we'll be ready to go 
sell and recruit pau torres immediately 
he wanted grealish and maddison ahead of bruno but because andreas pereira was so bad we've had to go for bruno i'm pretty sure that he wanted pau torres over varane and rice was obviously a priority for him 
we'd have to pay another 60m to get another cb like him and we are terrible at selling players so he'll probably leave for less than even 50m and unless we are getting a player like pau torres i don't see us replacing a cb like like saliba 
this year we just need reece james and pau torres 
lewa 25 raphinia 30 as they getting relegated koulibaly 60 70m neymar 50 60 same with pau torres 
i don't really fancy pau torres tbh he's just another lindelof 
nkunku tchoumeni reece james if he will come pau torres i think we'll be good then 
but rajesh you wanted pau torres mukiele and every single cb we've been linked to 😮 
its decent but some issues pau torres doesn't really suit the conte 3back de ligt is staying at juve apparently moura should be swapped with gil imo and brozovic got a new contract with inter if im not mistaken 
nkunku wouldn't fit he's like dele alli role however sms would be perfect pau torres is more of a ccb tho so not lcb for me 
we need to be improving adding depth in all areas imo starting with defence we need a strong left footed towering centerback over gone for pau torres but we could also go for bastoni a budget of around 40m for this hopefully we can use lo celso in the deal for torres 120m 
there is a lot u must add about 3 new players barela touchmeni pau torres darwin nunez and lautaro martinez let off mariano jovic vasquez valejo ceballos and lunini 
no pau torres would be more like 35 40 plus lo cello or straight up his rc 
pau torres would make absolutely no sense 
ndicka isn't even close to bastoni and pau torres is left footed yes but people forget in our system lcb need to go wide and move forward pau doesn't do that he's more of a ccb 
bastoni would cost 70m pau torres can be bought for lo celso 20m 
their is a €5mil diff between pau torres and bastoni i doubt our budget is only €60mil 
actually and unlike everyone i see that with all that money which we were going to give it all to that scammer we now can sign with many good players and young players who will be beneficial in long run there is nkunku pau torres tchouameni rb 
yes but i'm sure ndicka won't be a bad option and would cost 25m or pau torres who we would do a 20m lo celso deal 
he'd be a brilliant signing we could have him play at rb and sign pau torres to cover centrally timber is almost 5'11 too so i don't think his height is an issue 
pau torres everytime 
nope gvardiol because he is left footed and will be suited for a lcb kounde for the azpi role rcb dont think there's genuine interest in pau torres 
go ahead invest the following rw salah hazard bale out ss foden nkuku mariano out cmf tchounami rb reece james odriozola sale lb cucarella marcelo retired cb pau torres then label mbappe enemyofmadrid 
what about pau torres 
pau torres or ndicka at lcb and skipp at either cm and it's fire 
i would prefer pau torres and koulibaly 🦾 
update a traore left footed assist… for moi gomez 0 2 villarreal and he's hauled off immediately after poor lad 
🇪🇸 laliga ▶🇬🇴🇱◀ ⚽ gol de villarreal ⏱️ 55' 👤 moi gomez barcelona 0⃣ villarreal 2⃣ 
moi gomez controls adama's botched pass and rifles home 
really goes to show what incredible talent they've been blessed with over the years dani parejo is such a gem though 
carvajal nacho vazquez asensio that's in the current team let's look a little aboard mata morata negredo etoo marcos alonso dani parejo and callejon 
lautaro martinez aurelien tchouameni raphael guerreiro youri tielemens joshua kimmich mateo kovacic dani parejo few transfer mentioned above aren't possible but still i would love to see it happen 🥺 
colombian is luis javier suarez watford seem to sign pretty decent young strikers would love us to sign joao pedro think he might be the prem brazilian both as well as dennis have been on watfords books

listen up now because we need this players kaylor navas gk mukiele rb tielemans cm bissouma cdm renato sanches cm zaha lw gabriel jesus st darwin nunez st get some of them i promise you we will do better next seaon we might even win el ✌️ 
mike summerbee jesus navas fernando all the city legends 
have another suggestion for you you could put militao rcb and complete jesus navas obj for rb just swap your left side to the right 
they're already targeting lewa bastoni perisic skriniar de vrij osimhen nunez jesus navas martinez lautaro while they sign these players we can only hope of getting them lol 
yeah im getting jesus navas need to play 4 more games but it's so boring 
i won't have enough time lmao i'll do tawamba with a friend then silver beasts jesus navas and i'm 3 10 in fati💪🏼😭😭 
need to finish tawamba fati silver beasts and jesus navas asap i've not been doing gameplay now it's badd😭 
hakimi is one of the best rbs in the game you have donnaruma euro champ in goal navas 3 time ucl winner as his sub neymar messi and mbappe in the front and you dont call this a super team i dont get it you think winning the league w that front 3 alone is sth special jesus 
very nice 👏👏 i'm interested to try him out for this weekend league with jesus navas 
gotta remove dest with jesus navas and maybe danjuma with fati 
could get suarez and alaba ur budget isn't that high cuz suarez is expensive now so i would not say buy him now and than in the future u could upgrade ur fullbacks u have no budget so i just got for jesus navas 
congrats bro 🎉 you could win your next league title next season with chelsea you thiago silva and jules kounde in a back 3 you love scoring headers right imagine ziyech and mount whipping you crosses from set pieces hmu let me smoothen the transfer talks btwn both clubs 
imagine after all this rebuilding thema we will end up jules kounde😭 
jules kounde and declan rice hopefully 
well he has been good on the ball and even without the ball to well definitely sure we will get a better replacement and i hope chelsea signs jules kounde from sevilla 
caps might never come but that has no bearing on joining a big club france are blessed with attacking talent olivier giroud moussa diaby anthony martial ousmane dembélé kylian mbappe karim benzema marcus thuram and jules koundé all ahead of him at the moment 
please jt tell chelsea and tt to sign aurelien tchouameni christopher nkuku darwin nunes ivan perisic jules kounde or maxence lacroix kalidou koulibaly by all means 
borna sosa carlos solar and jules kounde pls barca make it happen 
sevilla's jules kounde to chelsea final stages sofascore sev ath 
i'm so happy he did that real is too full of them selves things are not bound to go their way everytime a worse case happened the same thing to chelsea in the name of seville jules kounde the world did not shake we didn't write any statement now real madrid are acting 
same issue with jules kounde when chelsea get him 
chelsea going after jules kounde who is a similar height to timber but no one bats an eyelid mascherano was even shorter same height as lisandro martinez but excelled as a cb the pl is different to other leagues but it shows that it can be done we've just never tried it

how many positions will arsenal target and is lautaro martinez one of the big names in the striker list 
my only is if we sell salah his ego is becoming too much for us he needs to go to a madrid we need attackers who offer something different but still get the job done lautaro martinez a proper no 9 i would do anything in the world for us to sign raphinha and dembele 
lautaro martinez suppose it depends how big you really want to go 
i remember his penalty save against lautaro martinez in the home derby was a huge point everyone in that squad had a significant contribution congratulations 
you absolutely right bro i thought 💭 they would announced lautaro martinez as the mvp buh am glad my boy did forzamilan 💥 
yes someone like lautaro martinez would be perfect for you if you had a genuine threat you'd be much closer to city and liverpool at the moment your strikers are too wasteful 
owned by don lautaro martinez 
now we'l be talking kounde koulibaly lautaro martinez nkunku any 3 of them we'l put some respect on his name 
not what we need going forward we need some like darwin nunez lautaro martinez osimneh someone that will score 20 goals a season 
they're already targeting lewa bastoni perisic skriniar de vrij osimhen nunez jesus navas martinez lautaro while they sign these players we can only hope of getting them lol 
lautaro martinez to play as rw rice or bellingham to play at cdm cm kounde to play at rb here we go 🇪🇸 
what are you guys even saying leao is good but also plays mostly on the left we don't want another headache when we have vini hazard rodrygo in the same position wonder why no one is talking about lautaro martinez or even darwin nunez 
florentino should go on lautaro martinez 
or we just get lautaro martinez 
there is a lot u must add about 3 new players barela touchmeni pau torres darwin nunez and lautaro martinez let off mariano jovic vasquez valejo ceballos and lunini 
probably gonna replace him with lautaro martinez 
lautaro martinez aurelien tchouameni raphael guerreiro youri tielemens joshua kimmich mateo kovacic dani parejo few transfer mentioned above aren't possible but still i would love to see it happen 🥺 
half baked theory jamie maclaren is the australian extremely poor man's lautaro martínez and that's not exactly a compliment to either 
lautaro martinez to play as rw rice or bellingham to play at cdm cm kounde to play at rb here we go 🇪🇸

follow all in those era it was a good cause in order to stop corruption jesus came with liberty but many of you abused it so you turned that to license for sin but the judgment is fixed for the end so no one is allowed to do that under the new testament 
i know dude jesus i was being sarcastic as well and to great success it seems

so did former future leeds player michael cuisance 
imagine udogie on the left and cagliari's raoul bellanova on the right 🔥🔥 i'd luv to see them both at juve 
he was good bruh he saved a joao pedro chance that could've easily gone in 
just like joao pedro jorge molina doesn't deserve this 
cagliari did not score and it costed them big time they deserve to go down because they relied too much upon 36 year old joao pedro 
😂🇮🇹´s striker woes i'm following the salernitana and cagliari games on the day balotelli scores 5 goals i remember the not so distant past where joao pedro was the solution to italy's wc problems 
brownhill joao pedro sarr pope tarkowski aarons pretty much it 
mancini called up joao pedro over this 🤡 
no one to summer transfers personally i'd go for tarkowski gilmour and joao pedro 
instead i had to watch berardi immobile joao pedro and insigne crimes against football 
cdt sub joão pedro hits the bar with a header from a free kick they're not throwing in the towel this tondela side
