next season chillwell chalobah thiago silva awb james mou would die for this lineup 
dg no flow 
we won't have signed thiago silva with your logic 
or thiago silva 
kante lost so much form mehn 
he's been consistent 
lukaku can’t ride a defender’s groin the whole game and expect passes ziyech is selfish useless havertz is overrated 
but thiago silva mount reece chalobah kovacic havertz are good to go 
is the guy afraid to release it early or what 🤮🤮🤮🤮 
i've always hated summer because there's no football season but i've been counting down the days for this season to end for about 2 months now players manager home crowd all total rubbish 
need to work on our finishing 
our best playmaker is thiago silva it's not good enough 
it's already in work 
but thiago silva for now

gallagher have no ounce of technicality 
so stop with the excuses all of them are true don't call it fake if u can't accept it 
thiago silva jorginho mount james in that order james and mount should be offered 8 year deals 
this doesn't look bad at all 🤝 
remember thiago silva was free still won trophies 😂 
well nobody wey no fii miss sha norms 
in hindsight should the club have signed thiago silva 
so u think a top quality defender of tryion lannister's height stands a chance of winning headers against maguire or silva 
he is a better shot stopper what disrespect lmao mbappe messi benzema halland thiago silva all played in that league

villa villa have shown they’ve got the money if leeds go down it has to be kalvin phillips if not joey veerman holland is back and because they produce talent 23 years of age no doubt a risk but if you can’t get kp… if he doesn’t take your fancy get sander berge decent 
this is a massive reason gerrard is looking for ball playing centre backs and a big enforcer who has a good eye for a pass also kalvin phillips 👀 so the creative freedom of players like coutinho and buendia can be maximised

and renew dembele and gavi and get raphinha and soler also👍 
unacceptable 💯🤷🏽‍♂️ we need another winger like raphinha or lewandoski 
and please look at leeds raphinha we need a left winger so bad 
torres should forget rw dembele x raphinha torres and fati auba and lewa 2 for each upfront neves replace busquet puig stays 
two of them 
not impressed by tarkowski though saying that there will be ashley type signings along the way they won't all be bruno as long as we buy others around them it won't hurt 
or dembelé or raphinha if leeds get relegated 🙂 
loan balde nico peña renew roberto dembele only if good deals can be reached sign lewa kessie christensen raphinha azpi simple enough plan assuming we can financially make it happen 
i don't really care if he comes or not but i'd love to see what happens 
if fati stays fit then yh thats a wc trio 
it doesn’t leave much room for amad though he can go out and loan but he’s still gonna come back and find sancho elanga rashford raphinha i really want to give him a go 
raphinha feels very in the mould of what a ten hag winger looks like but i don’t actually know how good he is 10 goals this season is a good return though 
annoying that mentally he’s moved on but what can we expect let’s hope we stay up not just for the obvious but to get top dollar for phillips raphinha 
here are my thoughts i still maintain them i think raphinha has a higher upside feel like he's less wasteful can always drift inside and not be a passenger and better 1 v 1 bowen in terms of end product now has edge https t co hrsv7n3rp3 
i'll expect them to snap up bissouma to partner him in a double pivot thats a top3 midfield in the league united easily get top4 with just these two signings if i were ten haag my summer would be cb koulibaly bremer cm bissouma amp neves fw raphinha 
son havertz raphinha mount tchouameni kovacic rice chilwel cb fofana james lukaku pulisic for son 
raphinha on the other hand will go regardless he has been a massive help for leeds these last two years and has stopped us from being relegated a few weeks ago lufc 
it's like we see a player of actual quality and instantly think he wants to leave and his heart's not in it raphinha got the same treatment proper borderline disorder stuff 
i believe he’s added some blonde highlights to his curly locks on top and in recent games i’ve seen some fresh zigzag shapes in his fade 10 10 for me very sharp from the bloke 🤣 
bruno fernandes chelsea vs arsenal 2nd leg bruno guimaraes backheel maximin raphinha 
he’s radz been as lucky with bielsa as vo was with raphinha in terms of signings leeds are lacking in ‘strategy’ radz is displaying all the characteristics of a seller

the brazilian ace made another excellent game finishing with danger executing good crosses and giving decisive passes also prevailing in the duels and contributing to the whites conquering one more point in the final stretch of the competition congrats raphinha 
leeds united counted on all of raphinha's category in the duel against brighton tied by 1 1 for the 37th round of the premier league this sunday 15 
only raphinha is an improvement absolutely no excuses for that having spent two years in the prem 
guys like raphinha and phillips for £30m would be decent business for most clubs i’d imagine 
lewandowski is a free agent this summer the takeover better hurry up and resolve cos these are massive opportunities 
at least i was never one of those ppl who wanted raphinha over other attacking options out there boweninho is better 
as i feel that raphinha won't come in cheap 
salah saka bowen raphinha olise neto gordon trincao palmer mbuemo sarr make up the rest of the top 10 
time to forget raphinha 
koulibaly grimaldo and raphinha aren’t on high wages in their current clubs and i’m sure barca will make it clear from the start it’s not bout d money 
city draw and then this i doubt burnley will gain any point from here this will cost raphinha 25 to 35 i think 
raphinha corner terrible and dealt with at the near post 0 1 on 90 1 lufc 
leeds raphinha everton rocharlison 
get raphinha 
raphinha turning the screw delightful arced pass from rodrigo in behind too leeds waking lufc 
raphinha doing long throws for some reason there 
dembele will tear his 🅰️🆑 doing those tackles 
so what do you say about our mottor more than a club 
… one touch passing at the back a beautiful raking ball to raphinha and a bullet cross is well blocked muscle memory 
atleast barca get raphinha for cheap now 
got the decision right there did dunk had to option to pressing raphinha out wide or falling back into the box fell back and was there to deny rodrigo lufc 
instead of weak players like pulisic or ziyech 
not sure why we insist on smashing the ball at raphinha from all angles hasn’t won a single header against cucarella yet the one time he stands him up he spins him pass it to his feet 
that’s your dembele replacement 
regardless dembele on his day is one of the best players if he could finish he’d be insane raphinha is good but not better than dembouz 
the only hope we have is if raphinha does something special because right now every other leeds player is lost 
much better than their last three outings but still shaky in possession and asleep in defence at times gelhardt and raphinha scrapping for everything rodrigo having another one to the point you get him off for his own good lufc 
think raphinha is destined for a champions league side in the summer 
terrible first corner from raphinha equally terrible clearance so he's got another go 
you’ve ziyech and odoi real ballers 👍🏽 
raphinha ghosting vs brighton aswell😭😭 
raphinha on a remotely serious team next year say it ain't so 
dembele dybala and even di maria for free raphinha possibly on the cheap antony the list is endless i think raphinha is off to barca 
dembele will go to psg because we wont act quickly enough no doubt 
this is very like the system bielsa left behind phillips the pivot in front of defence raphinha and harrison very wide on the wings looking for balls forward from the phillips zone decent start as well 0 0 on six mins lufc

the brazilian ace who has already scored 10 goals with the leeds united shirt this season is an important asset of the team and has been highlighted by printing quality in the creation of the whites' offensive plays being decisive in achieving positive results top raphinha 
raphinha is highlight on the sofascore statistical platform by integrating the list of brazilians with the most goals scored in the top 5 european leagues this season 21 22 
we need creative mf kounde tchouameni pogba kante swap deal kepa is leaving so we need a new backup keeper 
please play the players in the position that they were employed for raphinha is a right winger not full back or midfield round pegs round holes keep it simple stop trying to change things 2 games 6 points required 
you want us to go knocking on leeds' door for raphinha while dem dey battle relegation be like them never pour you hot water before 
amad has struggled in the scottish prem in one of the better sides i doubt he will make it at united raphinha or richarlson are prem ready and would easily improve our squad 
barca could actually be back next year potentially a threat again in the champions league this was our opportunity to win it but hopefully haaland can help lewandowski is basically already in barcelona and raphinha looks likely

↪️ most people just like reading the first half of reports and jumping to a conclusion seems like 😂 ℹ️ but what this basically means is that if raphinha to barça happens in the end it’ll be a 5 year deal this transfer is not done yet as we await leed’s final situation 🇧🇷

dan burn in particular has been a top signing as he's a fantastic penalty box defender particularly in the air he's a real leader at the back who's not too dissimilar in quality and stature to rob holding who is best suited to defending deep in his own box that's dan burn 
we also played against city and chelsea who were stronger i'm sure newcastle won't be that hard as most of the fans are making it to be their back line is still lascells and dan burn 
your wasting your time on propaganda and making strawmen to burn yourself with 
himself and mo were the senior players in that game till laca came on they were outrun by longstaff bruno g and joelinton what's he really on about 
who in our squad could have success with a similar reinvention 
fitness levels and desire are there now and the team shape balance is much improved 
your missus is terrified

whole team were great but the midfield 3 of joelinton bruno and longstaff worked so well together shelvey amp willock have their work cut out getting back in and calum wilson my god how we've missed him 👌 nufc 
deserves it for this joelinton remontada regardless 
ill call it the best coaching move of the season and that's discovering how much of a secret gem joelinton could be in midfield as opposed to a failed front player that's truly been a genius move 
joelinton should’ve got a yellow for repeat offences we were utter shit

the turnaround in players like krafth and especially joelinton has been amazing big joe winning player of the season just shows how much of a revelation he's been from £40m failure to midfield powerhouse in less than half a season

joelinton running circles around their midfield 
him and joelinton have been dumbbbb good today man wtf that first half performance alone deserved this win eddie howe might be cooking icl 
imagine a year ago saying he'd have 4 goals and be our poty i'd have thought we would have beaten derby's record low points total 
like that joelinton me since he went cm 
and i'm fully sold on joelinton staying in the starting xi get me jwp to partner the two brazilians and we're cooking 
excellent ball to joelinton in the lead up to the goal as well 
no card in sight 
75' how joelinton not got a booking is beyong me but so tough to see arsenal getting any goals nevermind two goals think it's europa next season

we're getting totally over run by joelinton and guimaraes 
midfield is being totally dictated by guimaraes and joelinton 
joelinton and asm inter change with targett's overlaps looks so dangerous saka has barely touched the ball and yet has been arsenal's best player

xhaka has been booked in 3 of last 6 appearances vs newcastle and he generally loves a crap tackle and a card anyway 9 in 24 joelinton is prone to a card 8 in 33 this season and assuming that he’s playing on the left side of midfield he’ll be up against saka odegaard

arsenal haven't finished top 4 with granit xhaka at the club there's a stat but no doubt you'll disagree with it 
great leader granit xhaka he gets yellow cards therefore he must care 
granit xhaka 
it takes granit xhaka 2 business days to swivel but bruno was flexing mad 
if you can't obey the coach stay at home 
i like granit xhaka and while he's not had a consistently smooth ride of it at arsenal by any stretch i think he has at times been misunderstood they didn't play well and naturally he comes out with a message to be better may not have the armband anymore but still a leader 
here you are defending granit xhaka cuz he batted his eyelashes at you after doing nothing 
granit xhaka gotta request a boxing match 
granit is simply stating a fact in games like this you have to have the balls the play it’s called ‘mentality’ look it up https t co mogdrjwqqh 
and granit xhaka man that dude lives and dies for his team don't ever try to tell me he doesn't care about the club 
he is a swiss international captain and most experienced player on the pitch and he couldn't even get control of the midfield and settle us down🙄 which top centre midfielders do👍🏽 
mind boggling to me how is granit xhaka the leader of this when he consistently disappears when it really matters crazy 
i'm praying this is the end of granit xhaka at arsenal as well go be a leader somewhere else bro we've seen enough

family we really work like that here it’s such a beautiful club ” elneny added ‘i always believed i do my job she let mikel do his job too and i respect his decisions he always does the right thing for the team that’s what i think 🔴⚪ ‘thomas partey and granit xhaka 
🟨 shown a card 1 granit xhaka 36 2 bruno guimaraes 10 3 joelinton 10 4 dan burn 9 5 cedric soares 7 
but he failed terribly because he has xhaka who can't perform cazorla role it's impossible to play like this with granit

manager ❎ i'd like ralph to be given the summer and until oct nov 
saintsfc and mccarthy in goal really 🤦‍♂️ 
having seen today’s game you can’t seriously tell me that lyanco stephens are any better than him not saying any are good enough to be starting prem cbs anyway but hate the fact that these fan pages have created an agenda against him 
we could have easily won today liverpool had nothing but same old saints same old ralph no effort at all their winning goal was assisted by us for fuck sake🤣other than lyanco get these cbs gone 
lyanco looked like our only player that had something about him today and guys an absolute liability 
you are one total 🔔🔚 
lyanco trying to flick it over origi in his own box realises he has fucked it up and will lose the ball tamely falls over atkinson buys it because he is utterly terrible at his job 
in from goal so'ton build up one of salisu left lyanco right widen which creates back four with salisu left walker peters right redmond left lyanco right auxiliary fullbacks in a back four re adjust high block presses early including on mccarthy kicks 1️⃣ 1️⃣ souliv 
in build up salisu left sided left footed lyanco right sided right footed on stephens centre right footed when liverpool start in 4 3 3 mid block as redmond left walker peters right main width givers redmond salisu ball side kwp lyanco ball side out 1️⃣ 1️⃣ souliv 
jota takes a touch gets clattered lyanco looks to have knocked jota’s leg into the ball for the second touch don’t know why var exists when they miss that 
salisu lyanco both do steps out as so'ton's flanked centre backs conservative less risky used to block inside pass lanes wing half space gt centre horizontal pass or step onto loose balls and restart stephens centre holds covering behind his flankers 1️⃣ 1️⃣ souliv 
i'm using a series of incidents that by your definitions are just body to body contact to point out how dumb you're being end of conversation 
amp even if he thinks lyanco has won the ball he’s clearly come through the back of jota which isn’t allowed 
that lyanco foul in the buildup to the goal is the most obvious blatant foul we really need to retire all these old crap refs amp promote some younger crap refs maybe we get a lucky pull and one of them isn't as crap as the likes of moss atkinson etc https t co oh511wgudg 
shocking decision on the lyanco jota foul 
bad ones see a yellow card awarded really bad ones see red it's fairly simple really not sure why you don't understand that 🤣 
walker peters tsimikas redmond gomez deep with wide back five used in mid block steps up done by redmond on gomez with movement in interiors set to draw steps out by salisu elliott lyanco jones liverpool set to overload interiors as alluded either side 1️⃣ 0️⃣ souliv 
thank the lord for taki minamino though
