They’ve been key to all of our successes this season.@GPv3000 Someone tweeted this because of CEDRIC SOARES btw@sportbible I am an arsenal fan and I think its a fair call, simply because cedric soares is just useless and he gave the referee a free call@SevenMillionn Arsenal was predicted to finish 7th/8th this season tho... this is a massive overachievement especially with Cedric soares and nketiah in the team@Arsenal coach pls rob holding should  be sold out of the club him n soares cedric d both of dem has cost us dis match.@PeggzAFC It was soft but not soft enough for var to overturn
You don't give the ref an option to give pens or reds these days, you behave. 
Rob holding and Cedric Soares did not.@soccerdiva Gotta ask why you would put Rob Holding and Cedric Soares together on the same side as Son. That is beyond naive.@Viqforlan Cedric soares is always doing that rubbish@CFC_Omondi Arsenal fans are blaming Cedric Soares because they think he is to blame for the loss against Holding. They think he should have done better defensively.@FPLProfessor_ It's seems like Anyone playing against Cedric Soares will be a hero 😂@AAllenSport If you thought Rob holding and Cedric Soares would do it for us you have a real problem. Fucking useless players@Arsenal But why would u start Rob Holding and Cedric Soares against @SpursOfficial @Arsenal is the enemy to self really.@FBI I heard that Cedric Soares and Rob Holding are part of YSL!1!1!@icandoakickflip Yes, Cedric Soares@Arsenal fashi making a striker your priority for next season, pleaseeeee just find a way to make sure Cedric Soares never plays for us again🙏🏾🙏🏾 Thank you@Arsenal Cedric soares gets poorer and poorer each gameCédric Soares gives the ball away very cheaply and allows Harry Kane to get loose on the edge of the box.

Takehiro Tomiyasu blocks the initial shot and then Emerson Royal lashes his shot wide.

You see Rob rolling around making a fuss?? No, perhaps he should of. 

I do say when it’s our own fault. Maybe not always on here, but I do. You have to understand my views are from Coaching perspective, I used to be one@Stinga_man Jah jah bro suh it guh we just affi win the remaining two games, rob holding stupidness mek the game change 🤦. Plus me nuh know why utd fans a talk and dem might end up in a different ucl 🤷@joeldoug1 @TheImmortalKop Rob holding@keemzo @sanchezwatt Paid for and the currency was Rob Holding’s brain cells@Abhi_Musik @Arsenal Rob holding got sent because he forgot to apply his rogaine pre kickoff. Unlucky@paleplayboy @afcstuff Rob Holding doesn't tho@EGTVEgal But that was the wrong decision Egal, please just let this go bro the man that cost us the game today was Rob Holding. We lost to the better team on the day unfortunately, but we will still get top 4!!@piersmorgan Stop moaning and blaming arteta I don’t even support Arsenal but give him a break you act like it’s his thought when really it’s rob holding shows you don’t like arteta has aubameyang got something to do with it ?@Pearl_FreeAfc You can literally draw a straight line from this comment towards blatant racism
Xhaka has gotten about 3redcards since this Pepe incident, you will never hear Mikel Arteta say something like this about him or Rob Holding today@AnTottenhamism @OdeSzn_ @HotspurRelaled Rob Holding?@SkySportsPL Your tweet was quoted in an article by Metro https://t.co/WesxIVngtn@jamiebcfc7 Rob Holding has an absolutely atrocious performance and suddenly there is a mad conspiracy theory that the premier league want a show down for 4th 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ 

Btw this game was rescheduled 😂@TheSpursExpress Yeah, it was destroyed by Rob Holding and the rest of the goons. Cry more!@GoonerGirl1969 The 1st goal was always going to be big in this game. For me it was never a penalty. The red mist just descended on Rob Holding. No problem with his 2 x yellow cards. Do have a problem with VAR not looking at Son elbowing Holding in the Face, during their 1st tussle.@MargsMT Rob holding is the BTEC Maguire 😂😂😂@FruitpunchL Bro it’s killing me. How do they still have Cedric in defence 😂😂😂😂. Rob holding has to be a BTEC Maguire.@ShikariJase @PUFC_Will @HotspurEdition @xGPhilosophy Suck on it pal. Rob Holding got deserved both of those bookings. Even Arsenal players are saying that. Son get battered in the air for the Pen which was deserved. Then you got outplayed.@ConMarbleHalls There is some imposter pretending to be Arsenal fans trying to disrupt the unity of the real fans. 
I think that we were robbed in today's game. The Pen given was never a Penalty.
The Rob Holding Red was never a Red. Absolutely POOR 💩 refereeing@iam_philopearl Please leave Arteta out of it. It's Cedric Soares &amp; Rob Holding that God will punish 😩😩😩

#TOTARS@FartInTheBath Your da with Rob Holding hair in Turkey is dangerous. Save some for the rest of us mate.@mimshach_md @dasilva_4 It’s not about scapegoating. I literally sent a tweet complaining about Cedric before the penalty. Putting him and rob holding on one side was never going to work. He’s a terrible defender, white covers for him so we don’t see it. Holding ain’t so athletic, so he’s exposed.@Arsenal Rob Holding massively cost us this game@SkySportsNews Stupid talk!

He will say that rubbish bcus it favoured him today!

Rob Holding gave him the mouth to talk any how!

Nonsense!@ani_ela_ Anny we were just letdown by the foolishness of Rob holding asap@SalibaEra_ To me that's a pen what really cost us the game was Rob Holding redcard I don't think we would've lost if it weren't for that needless 2nd yellow card 🤞@thespursweb Rob Holding had 4 yellow cards so a red was due. Arteta is such a complete bell end.@LeGrove Rob holding was wired from the start … over pumped up and played into son’s hands. Two needles fouls and altercations in the sc@ms own half.
Smiling aka Costa like and the 4th official clocked it.
They communicate btwJust had another thought:

In big matches, good referees often (almost always) give a player a final warning before issuing a second yellow card. Rob holding was not afforded that luxury. He was sent off for his next foul after picking up his first yellow.@deafvulgaris Which decision did you have issue with? A player taking out son who turned away from the ball or Rob Holding shoulder checking Son in the face? A red Card in a rugby match btw.@ChrisBa83277594 @TheLankyGunner @MJA_Gunners Where have I blamed the ref and not Rob Holding? 😉@althechook @TheLankyGunner @MJA_Gunners Haha. I've riled the halfwit with an abysmal understanding of the rules of the game. Rob Holding is the one you want to be pissed with, not me or the ref. You could easily have turned that game around if he wasn't such a cretin. Sweet dreams buddy, and don't let 4th slip!@ArsenalAmore Yes against Newcastle that would what we have to do but tonight not a chance in hell Tavares was starting this game and that's what we would have had to do the only reason we lost was because of Rob Holding destroyed eney chance we had of getting back into the gameThe disappointing part is that of all the #Arsenal players, Rob Holding, a guy who has been through it before (he played in FA Cup finals!) was the biggest letdown on the day.rob holding didn’t work alone. not a single person warned him that he’s going way overboard. there was no instinct to inform him that his behavior was placing the entire collective endeavor in jeopardy. that’s a systemic failing. I hope it’s a matter of age but coaching fixes it.@sexysm1throwe @PoorEPLreferees Considering Rob Holding’s wasn’t a red but instead a second yellow, at most this could have also been a yellow.@AFCDavid147 @FA I did think for the second yellow that that sort of thing happens every game but because of the height difference just pushing your arm out (as every player does every time the push a player away) has cost holding. Just wish Rob had gone down holding his face for this.@CajetanOdhiambo @thfcle @rafildo_faza @bhavss14 Nowhere in that clip does sons elbow touch holding, he is clearly trying to stand up but rob is holding him down@SkySportsPL How about you tell it how it is. Rob Holding was not good enough. The sending off killed the game. It’s not everyday protect players when they make stupid and reckless decisions.@SpursOfficial Rob is holding what? A red card?@afcstuff I don't think you can appeal a second yellow?

Also, watch the replays and imagine Rob Holding is a lamppost, if Son runs forwards, whilst looking backwards and runs into a lamppost, is it the lamppost's fault? 🤔@LewisRichardsLR gabriel injured, rob holding red card. Newcastle on monday we’re ducked we don’t have a proper defence 😂😂@justkinggg_ @G4Lpodcast @mcarsenalfan @TheArsenaltube @Emzyl_ Why are you bashing Rob holding today then because he was bought for 5m and on low wages. What a reason🤪🤪. If you working for a company and you made a  huge mistake. You shouldn’t be bashed because you earn less and your Colleague on higher income should be judged instead . Wow@Supreme_Wenger Rob Holding doesn't deserve his new hairRob Holding totally wanted another gif made out of today.@oacervantes 🤣🤣 it’s a bad day. Hurts, but it happens. Punk ass Rob Holding totally outclassed@jamesallcott Rob’s got Flav holding on@footballdaily DJ Rob Holding disasterclass came.@afcfeyz Rob Holding listened to too much motivational talk.@DTDCGooner @Mhumm101 It’s also pretty tough to argue that Rob Holding would have stayed on that pitch for 90 minutes even with more lenient reffing. He was on a hell of a lot of tilt@ceejaytick @Sugamite2 Blame Rob Holding let Arteta be, Arteta didn't tell Holding to be dumb in the pitch, holding has witnessed various North London Derbies including the one that cost us a penalty when he fouled son. Arteta did nothing wrong@Akwesi_Jeff @JoeyTHFC @RoRo_Bespoke Direct this to Rob Holding not me😂😂💔@SkySportsPL Rob Holding was okay to kick and throw Son before he was even booked. Leave it out like@TegoSigel His Rob Holding take over Maguire aged horribly, at least Harry can make it through halftime 😂@khalifa_ih Super dirty. Mainly courtesy of Rob the Holding 😂@EDApps84 @ClockEndMark @georgeachillea Well done you beat Rob Holding and Cedric put that in the trophy cabinet@Mrjamieohara1 as a Sheffield United fan I thought spurs were ace.  Hopefully see ya next season.  Rob holding should hold himself in shame. He could be been booked five times before he got the red@piersmorgan Dom Cummings "Strong rumours abound that Rob Holding will be granted a free transfer"@Gazwthegooner Agree. Of our own making. I give little credit for the win. A very soft pen and down to ten early as Rob Holding’s head went from kick off.

In absolute control for 20. He’s to blame. Nobody else. A gift from us.@Sonny7 had Rob Holding in his pocket the entire time@RyanBachoo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 they obviously conspired to give Rob Holding that darn Red Card 😅@GilbertoSilva @Arsenal Rob Holding 3-0 Arsenal@FinnBalor @SpursOfficial Thought that was Rob Holding on top of @Sonny7 for a minute.@TheArsenalFlair @footballdaily Rob Holding made three silly tackles before getting booked the first time@Georgeloxdale @LiamOB18 Rob Holding with an LOB Olchfa U12's display #gingermist@poju79 @sexysm1throwe @PoorEPLreferees Show me where rob holding got an elbow in the face@declanvarley Rob Holding, Rob Elbowing, Rob Walking.@Iamsulaimon You should always think twice when you're playing tactics of targeting an opposition player. Might not have been the deciding factor, but a key factor tonight was the gunners indiscipline. Rob Holding right from the start was too physical with Son Heung-min.@acollins876 I can't think of a more aptly named individual than Rob Holding.2. Arsenal

Rob holding and Cedric 😭@pjbuckleydecor @MirrorDarren Did you watch the game or just from the penalty decision on? The first 30 minutes we were well on top. Penalty for a non existent push and a red card because Rob Holding has a right elbow. Son threw an elbow at Holding early on and should've gone@SUGARCLYVE We all watched the game.

Quickly get rid of him and get a proper defender.@officialridadex @AFCAMDEN That's a clear penalty. He backed SON and he didn't jump. That's a foul tbh.

Remember, Rob Holding or Bellerin did exactly the same foul to Harry Kane or SON at the Emirate and it was also given as penalty. ( I can't recall the season)@ChrisWheatley_ Rob holding  robbed arsenal 3 points.  I think he was trying to mark Son hung min, but he was doing something crazy which is not expected from a person at Emirates for 6 years. Ridiculous@ChrisWheatley_ Conte taking the piss. 😂 Bin Rob holding this summer@TomiyasuShogun @Yurt1992 @AFCAMDEN I agree, the Refs are a corrupt bunch of pricks and that WE never get the right calls all season long. Son should have seen a red on a VAR review for elbowing Rob Holding. That's clear. This is also a clear pen. Does Cedric ever make an attempt to play the ball? No.@_iamTerry Rob Holding was terrible tonight. But the ref kinda killed the game.@GenericGooner @thfcsxn @STU1VENBERG @OzilThings It was a 100% penalty
It would have been a guaranteed goal if Rob Holding didn't push Son@charles_watts Let's face fact. We were leading spurs with 4 points and there is no need of Rob holding doing this shit to cost us like this. Am very surprised is no other player than holding who has been doing well for us.What he did is needless.Meanwhile the referee warn u and still did this@lucasganzerla @FA 🤣🤣🤣 remove rob holding more like@muhammadatk Rob Holding deserves to be dismissed, he has to learn how to handle huge match pressure like this one.@AFC17t Exactly, had Rob been whipped off before this, there’s nothing to say we couldn’t get back into this game.

I loved it but in these soft as shite times I knew the big man was taking the long walk.@Arsenal I swear with my father’s grave, Rob Holding was playing against us.@TheShortFuse HAHAHAHAHAA Rob Holding decided he wanted to play Billy Big Bollocks tonight and you paid the price. Clearly came out trying to rattle Son and instead, rattled his way right into an early bath. Hilarious@freddie Arteta n Rob holding sat down and agreed that the best way to stop spurs counter attacking is to let them score very early and let them control the game.

📸 Getty Images https://t.co/Gr5eMNr2eg@Arsenal Well done guys!

Some of you still need discipline and professionalism especially in a crucial and important game like this!
Rob Holding really and betterly fucked up tonight and it's very difficult for me to forgive him bcus he should have done better!Rob holding saw red in the first half after two bookings for fouls on Son heung-min, meaning he will be suspended from Monday night's trip to Newcastle.

📸 Getty Images https://t.co/iJOQ5lL0tn@ltarsenal Rob Holding deserve to be sent off let be honest , But the penalty was soft@GunnerLoulou All the usual things happened! Son swung and elbow at Holding and gets away with it! 😡@Gladtroax It’s kinda mad cos if Rob Holding would’ve done what Son did when he got elbowed in the face Son probs would’ve been sent off@ChrisWheatley_ Kudos to the team despite the loss,  They played professional football... Rob Holding cost  us everything tonight 
But the next fixture IS A MUST WIN fixtures 
@ least One goal to end all matches@IeeSZN Rob Holding Las Vegas Raiders quarterback 🤮🤮🤮@brfootball How did Rob Holding think that situation was eventually going to end,you're playing in big derby game and you start throwing yourself about like that into Son most of the time that you're on the pitch. He has let he's side down massively.@themodernera2 @AFCLWJ @FRANXICAN Clearly there was exposing he got rob holding sent off and earned a penalty and scored a goal 😂@ArsenalNat84 True. I think it was a stark reminder that Holding, Elneny, and Cedric are not top 4 players. Rob played right into Son's hands and at 26 yo he should know better. We need improvement. Fingers crossed Gabriel is fit against Newcastle.@SkySportsPL I'll say it for him "Rob Holding was a fucking idiot"@sportbible 😂😂 Think you should have a word with rob holding!! Should of been booked 2 fouls before!!@SkySportsPL Your tweet was quoted in an article by TalkSport https://t.co/6KrKMM5tn0@Arsenal I blame Arteta. Even an infant could see that Rob Holding was begging for a red. What exactly was he thinking? Ffs this is a professional and many things were at stake. What the actual f is wrong with him? Should have been subbed off after his first yellow. Ruined everything@TheSpursExpress By rob holding you melt@Adaeze_michael I heard all your analysis/paralysis on how Spurs were organized and all when you simply asked about Holding's red card. You didn't need to try so much when the answer was clear. Referee and Rob Holding took the sting out of the game and eventually gave spurs the result@sportbible …by Rob Holding@TheSpursExpress Yeah, by Rob Holding 😂@movethebalI He will be pissed at Holding but that’s for behind closed doors.

I guarantee he will have Rob in his office tomorrow to discuss it.#UPDATE Arsenal had to play most part of the game with 10 men following Rob Holding’s sending off in the first half.

Despite the defeat @Arsenal are still in fourth place on 66 points, just a point ahead of Spurs with two games left to play.

#TOTARS https://t.co/q9wlAlpuHK@beewestwood So Rob Holding didn’t deserve to be sent off? Clueless@LoganTaylor34 @Sonny1Daze @NBCSportsSoccer The circumstances were that Son had Rob Holding on skates every single time down the pitch. What was it by the penalty?  The 4th foul?

Holding committed countless fouls and a stupid challenge after just being booked, should be furious with Rob Holding@daddycraigdaws It was a soft penalty tbh but rob holding was a total fucking idiot he could of got a straight redImagine being 4 months better prepared and then letting Rob Holding do that. Wasn’t really worth it, lads.@thedailybop @JamesAFTV What? You play Cedric on the left, as he did for numerous games last season. You do not unbalance your back four by playing your two weakest defenders on the same side against Spurs best attacking threat. Rob Holding/Tomi, Gabriel/Cedric. You pair strong with weak.When Ayling went to uproot Martinelli’s legs and only got a yellow card, you have to wonder how Rob Holding got that first yellow card. It needed a very willing referee to accomplish.@danielpheysey Goon of the game Rob Holding man of the match Harry Kane.@jamurr10 @arseblog Rob Holding has been good for us lately when called upon.

As one of the most experienced players in the side, he needed to show composure and he faltered just when we needed him most.@Arsenal Rob Holding should be sold now- anyway he won’t play the final two games - as if he was determined to be sent off. @m8arteta should have taken him out after his first booking@afcIsaac You should have gave him your two leg when Rob Holding was shown red so as for Martin to cover up the space@malex200311 @thfcjack_7 Rob holding red works@Callum190311 @AFCBenjh @holumitz123 @Valentoney @Dmack119119 No I can’t, you don’t give Rob Holding a new contract and keep Saliba who is miles better. You then have a better backup who won’t bottle it in big games.@MC_of_A Everything Rob Holding did for half an hour.@Con_Casts Pissed off with Rob Holding tbh@EL_Kaniel @Arsenal Individual errors, mainly Holding cost us that game. All Rob needs to do is hold him up. You just said “out CB still not communicating” that’s on them, not https://t.co/aMDM6bOOtE was only 5-10 yards from that to protect for a lot of the 33 mins before the card.@Arsenal Rob holding a senior player with amateurish mistakes today@GoonerTaIk Absolute disgrace. If Holdings nudge on Son is a second yellow, Son’s deliberate elbow on Holding on the floor is a red. We’ve been absolutely played there. It’s a hard loss to take, but they’ve still won fuck all in 14 years and they are still tinpot. Up the Arsenal.@MattyMCFCC @AbrasiveVPG @RSG_Andz @RobinhohoodJ @lWhiteleyl @Marshallboy72 @Doylees04 @Spannerz11s @VPGEuropeXbox Sorry that was mean blame rob holding for that@Arsenal please keep rob holding forever 🤍@ArtdeRoche No rob holding got it wrong we set up to play our game and that’s what we did well for the first 15, the occasion got the better of a player who should have enough experience not to act like an imbecile, the thing Arteta got wrong was not playing an Unfit white over said idiot.@sahoepriv Elneny wasn't the issue, it was Cedric and Rob holding that cost us@NickRTFM Ben white &gt; average prem cb &gt;🗑 &gt; 🗑 🗑 &gt; Rob holding@RickyB1662 Things happen behind the scenes that we don’t fully know 🤷🏽‍♀️ Rob Holding getting a red card is on Rob Holding and not Arteta. I’d rather rest Ben White and play him for our last two crucial games than risk playing him in a losing game@jvhorssen @tomgunner14 @Arsenal We have to play wholeheartedly and make sure we secure that champs league place. Today a draw would have done it but that Rob Holding red card was where we lost it all@Anna_96_10 Rob Holding Happened@EddieOliech @SpursOfficial @Arsenal When you’ve seen Rob holding do what he has today absolutely not mate 😂 but yet again fair play to the yids moving into the top 4@frcsmarr Rob Holding masterclass 💀💀@traakkyy Rob holding made like 4 fouls in the first 35 minutes@FemooAFC @Melavin If rob holding had a bit smartness about him the match wouldn't have been sabotaged like this, the players were in a bit of panic, couldn't think what to do, how to execute,after rhe red card incident@tomjd1975 Rob's holding on to his hairline.@SamJDean cause it was a throwback to last season cause of rob holding 🤣@harryyy____ rob holding down the changing room 🥶@petkin93 😂 cant account for Rob Holding and Cedric tbh we no fit handle the pressure@Arsenal I don't blame the ref. It was a red card. Those two yellow cards were worth it. I don't know what is wrong Rob and those nasty challenges. Son was not even going to get the ball. Holding cost us the game@idextratime ▪️ Gabriel subbed off with an apparent hamstring injury against Spurs
▪️ Rob Holding banned for one game after two yellow cards against Spurs
▪️ Ben White just recovering from an injury

ada yg mau nemenin west ham di UEL nih wkwkRob Holding 🟥 Card screwed the bet, very close, unlucky https://t.co/z7XEmicLiD@tos2fame You can kiss Arteta’s ass for all I care. If you think it makes more sense to keep Rob Holding and loan out Europes best young CB then your brains is unused 💯@GeoffShreeves why are you asking son about the red card incident ask Rob Holding you absolute dinosaur? Terrible interview get some class@_PrinceNN @Povi_don I don't give Son a red card for that Elbow on Rob Holding either. But after that I'm consistent in how I call these 50/50s. Not a foul on Son in the box.@perseguidorsep rob holding@lefaskuman That red card by Rob holding is the fault of Arteta than the player himself if you look at the approach this coach took, now we must sit and say we have a coach and we can compete in Uefa, thats not on@Jelly86 Is this rob holding’s dad?@3hoodaMM rob holding ? goat status 🙌🏽🙌🏽@ohnosharky Holding rob us of vital points today
And thanks to Paul Tierney also@saltimes @Arsenal Why would you blame the referees when our team just didn’t perform? Hate to single out Rob Holding but early red cards change the game. We go again 💪🏻@LiamCrook1 U can’t do a stupid foul like that when you’ve got a weasel of ref like Paul Tierney around and Rob Holding has let the club, fans and more importantly his teammates down coz he didn’t believe he cud deal with Son with his own ability, he played like a Championship player@Arsenal Rob holding and Cedric should never play again for Arsenal 😭@ArsenalFCView @Arsenal That pen was the softest I’ve seen all season. Think he gives it to Son because he didn’t stop crying. Son elbows Rob Holding in the jaw and gets nothing. Can’t tell me that’s fair? Agree Rob let his emotions get the better of him and lacked intelligence up against a cheat.@1gbelward @AlexWeeks86 I’m enjoying this 😂 BTW Rob holding is a dickhead awful decision to get that 2nd yellow@Arsenal @Footbbboll To rob holding
Learn soccer again 😅@bet365 Yes I understand that, but then rob holding initial yellow card should be taken away, as you cannot be card 3 times in a game?@TrollFootball If anyone is to blame it's rob holding@of_bryce @afcstuff rob holding happened@saltimes @Arsenal Referee is ok,the problem is arsenal mentality, ask yourself how comes 10man Leeds perform better against Arsenal than how 10man Arsenal perform against Tottenham?
This is the question.
 And Rob holding second yellow offence should see him benched till end of his contract.@piersmorgan From a spurs fan - you have a short term memory. Think back to September last year and where you were. You’ve improved a lot! What caused you that game was Rob Holding being a nob and getting sent off for losing his head. Nothing more, nothing less. Adiós.@maxrushden @guardian_sport @NickAmes82 @_JordanJBryan @bglendenning Does @bglendenning think Rob Holding could have potentially played his last game for Arsenal? Mikel Arteta is known for his ruthlessness…@Andy_destroyer1 Rob holding@Arsenal Kindly show us the image on. Rob Holding watching game in the dressing room. We want to see how he was celebrating.@haz_afc Rob Holding and Cedric are the senior players in that team. They let us down.@ESRodinho @thespursweb No that’s Rob Holding you’re on about 😌@SpillerOfTea @SamWhyte Are you suggesting Rob Holding is our 1st choice centre half? 🤣🤣🤣@Rob_Taylor77 @Yorkie901 @EssexPR Ha ha, sky said it was a Holding handball, otherwise no foul.@TikiTakaConnor Relax blame Rob Holding and get over your subjective thoughts.@thfcpain @SpursOfficial Rob holding off the pitch _ T4

Wow@CFC_Andy_ @Arsenal Neither is Rob Holding, not fit to play!! 😂@Arsenal Rob Holding 😡😡@Behzinga @chrismd10 Maybe if we brought you on you could have done better than Rob Holding@who_is_hi @goal @Sonny7 Would've been better if you said: Rob holding son and gets sent off.  😁@wallacemenace So he is going to move on rob holding ? No bro he got a leadership role ..even cedric is in his plans@BenjaahEdwards You are holding onto the past it will rob you of lots of your trophies happiness sir@Arsenal Why can't our defence act like a defence for once and not play these recklessly Rob holding he knew how important this match was but still showing a childish play in a game as important as today .... He should know who was responsible for today loss..@NiallDunn Rob Holding getting stupid cards in positions they wouldn’t get fuck all from!@DeadMenTalkPod Freddy wont get near Rob with that reach disadvantage. Would be like holding a midget at arms length.@Asuzu89 @adekkzy @Arsenal I just felt he shouldn’t have put him on the bench at all. Just me though. As for Rob Holding. I have no words@maxrushden @guardian_sport @bglendenning @NickAmes82 @_JordanJBryan Trying to think of a better example of nominative determinism in football than Rob Holding this evening.@Arsenal Shoot Rob Holding into space@JordanUsername one good 3-0 deserves another 3-0. gg, except for rob holding.@Bob25018554 @premierleague Kane 4 fouls no cards 
Rob holding 2 fouls 2 cards

#Arsenal@didithitthespot @Arsenal So I'm supposed to celebrate rob holding getting sent off?? What are you smoking@Arsenal thank you rob holding for throwing away this game for us. mature level at best championship, completely owned by son@Arsenal If by summer Cedric and Rob holding is still in this team den we are not ready@EduardoHagn We all know the boys will choke, Just see how Rob Holding was playing couldn't he just relax for a moment@CFC_Andy_ @Arsenal Arteta picks the wrong team Emile Smith Rowe on the bench always, it’s a joke. He’s got great players but uses them in the wrong combination, Rob Holding on the pitch Ben White on the bench really!!??@Tactical_Times Rob Holding put the Arse in Arsenal.@RamiE93 Sure, wasn't a peno, wasn't a sending off. Refs are against this great Arsenal team. Rob Holding is better than VDV. Nketiah the next Drogba and Saka better than Neymar 🤣🤣🤣🤣@m8arteta made this game look like football tactic is rocket science, let Tomiyasu play RB, Tavares LB, bring in Ben White for Rob Holding, it's not that complicated but inexperience is his biggest problem, look at him whenever we concede first, he already gives up. #TOTARS@MGH Top 4 is still in our hands if we just beat Newcastle and Everton. Rob Holding was terrible, questioning why White wasn’t on the first place. The subs didn’t make the game better either. We looked good at the start but after Rob’s first challenge against Son we weren’t that good.@Peterhoest Rob holding being an honest lad…if that was son he would have required a neck brace@ms_muktar16 I blame it on rob holding and cedric costly silly mistakes what you mean ..if Pepe or elnenny did it ..You would hear the chants to kill them@JBxIxx But why, in your humble opinion, is the Rob Holding one a straight red, but this elbow to the head a yellow?@Arsenal We did our best considering the conditions we faced! I can only blame Rob Holding for being insensitive to the techniques of Derby matches ! He brought us down@BraveSirrrRobin Rob Holding decided this game. He received no sanction for kicking Son in the kidney and did well to stay on the field as long as he did. Literally nobody who doesn’t wear red and white thinks that wasn’t a penalty.@Holte_ender1 @Arsenal New hair, same Rob Holding, shite@itslafajj Rob Holding this L@bhavss14 Call rob holding out this is on him but we move@Arsenal I can forgive Rob Holding for what happened today because he is not a first team player and only got to play because we had no options

#Top4orNothing@Luke_MCFC prolly a blessing in disguise for us, tonight made it pretty clear that champions league football with xhaka elneny n rob holding was never a wise idea💀@rout_josh1 Rob Holding decided to play WWE@Arsenal What a performance, every player was top class. Rob Holding and Elneny take a bow. That’s too 4 sorted!@orlacon0 We are good before the Penalty but Rob Holding has cost us with lack of desipline. 

How can U have two yellow card from this crucial match .@decysull @curtisshaw9 He decide to sign Cedric and give Rob holding a new contract when they both aren’t good enough, but Saliba wasn’t ready. So yeah it is on Arteta.✅ Spurs (+115)
✅ Over 2.5 (-125)
✅ Xhaka to get booked

A clean sweep on today’s picks. Real disasterclass from Arsenal and Rob Holding in particular. The battle for fourth is going to the wire!@charles_watts Rob Holding ruined that for us. But we go again.@KingBukayo_ @SpursOfficial Rob holding a runner 😭😭😭👍@SpursOfficial Rob Holding may have lost his head but this is poor management from Mikel Arteta.

Why give him a £8m contract per year when he hasn’t earned it? He has the least pressure &amp; this inexperienced, ‘yes man manager’ is going to finish us.

Get him out.

#ArsTot@Markkklam15 @Arsenal Yh of course. Its artetas fault for rob getting a stupid yellow for holding son and then elbowing him.👍👏👏👏@intersctellar good thing you didn’t name it rob holding@SpursOfficial Rob Holding today https://t.co/pd3h1eg4BD@SORLTHAN_ Rob was holding spurs back 😂@LeeW_78 Rob holding and Cedric have them the game, onto Newcastle@Arsenal Rob Holding failed us tonight 😢@Arsenal Rob Holding needs to goPrime example? Rob Holding. 

That guy was absolutely shitting it - tried intimidating Son &amp; instead got himself sent off in the first half. 

Arsenal reeks loser mentality - North London is white. 🤍@inodeycarrylast @Sonny7 @HKane No they are not lol. The refs couple of calls already gave inclining on how the game would be. Rob holding is a dunce. But it’s you people that are quiet when your team plays but loud when other people play that vex me@Sly1495 Rob Holding should’ve got a straight red, also Gary Neville said straight away it hit Moura’s hand 😂@Arsenal Rob Holding’s fault.@Arsenal Can’t say much. Penalty was soft but Rob Holding lost us the game at the end of the day. Was full time as soon as he stupidly got sent off and he has to own that.@drm148 @Awofeh007 @SkySportsPL Pretty much all pundits accept its a deserved second yellow and anyone that has played football agrees but some lad on twitter know more than all of them 😂 Rob holding is shit and looked like an amayure from the start of the game@Arsenal Congrats to Rob Holding.  Man of the Match performance for Tottenham 🤣@Arsenal To Rob Holding

At the end of a storm
Theres a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone@Arsenal Rob Holding may have lost his head but this is poor management from Mikel Arteta.

Well done to Rob Holding for keeping his composure in one of the biggest games of the season.

Rob Holding@Essexgooner94 @Woodhouse_m @HotspurRelated Rob Holding is the one you need to blame. Committed 4 yellow card offences.@mkway89 na rob holding@ltarsenal In the 1st instance we should only blame our very low quality players like Soares, Holding and Elneny!! When rob had the yellow I knew it will soon turn red for him! he was playing like a 17yrs old player!! Didn't know why to play a stupid player like him when White is at bench!@lilpoasterboi rob holding knew u weren’t watching and did a bad thing@bhavss14 Rob Holding and Cedric say hi.@stuafc71 @FA_PGMOL I asked rob holding at the training ground yesterday if he’s going to have a good game and he said yes 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️@Arsenal @m8arteta team selection shouldn’t be based on recent performances but on absolute capabilities. Sell Rob Holding and integrate Saliba@nonewthing Rob Holding cost us today, absoloute clown he is@Arsenal Well done Rob holding you may of cost us the chance to get 4th place by stupid decisions in the space of few minutes, I told my mate you will get sent off after 5 mins of seeing you play!! You've let the club down@Rob_Adtr No holding, no Gabriel, 50% White 🤣@henrywinter Accept he shouldn’t have been on the pitch after elbowing Rob Holding@pippa_monique Rob holding is shit@oh_that_crab Without white he maybe got tempted away but surely rob holding tomi and gab could’ve done@iamGUZE @Funshoopawoye According to @OptaJoe Rob Holding made four fouls against Spurs leading up to his dismissal, with all four of them coming on Son Heung-min. His four fouls are the most he has ever made in a Premier League game, despite only playing 33 minutes. Unrestrained.@SpursOfficial Man of the match: Rob Holding Son... https://t.co/g4iZvcm3PO@Lewishartson 😂😂😂 no way you’re beating Newcastle without rob holding@Trainwreckstv bro calm it, Rob Holding shouldn't have been on the pitch in the first place. Wasn't Ref's fault I'm afraid. Sucks to be an Arsenal fan..@murphdada You are a dunce. His starting 11 is questionable and that alone cost us this match. Starting Rob fucking Holding in the most important game of the season is a disaster.@piersmorgan What did Arteta do wrong, Rob Holding messed up@piersmorgan Not arteta tonight thats on Rob holding@Paddy__Paddy @markwhlte On a scale of 1-10, how thick is Rob Holding?@Arsenal Rob holding let us down@SauceEpice Rob holding il banalise les masterclass ?@tomwilliams_8 Brain dead Rob holding back on displayIs @Arsenal’s defense in a crisis?

Rob Holding is suspended for one match following a double yellow, Ben White was not fit to come on as a sub, and now Gabriel Magalhães goes off with a hamstring injury. #TOTARS@RebZMano He went in, but it's too late now. Because Rob Holding took instructions from Teta to be tough on Son literally.@BasedDraven bro im talking about rob holding

got sent off stupidly and completely ruined the north london derby 🤣@piersmorgan Here we go again arsenal loose let’s bring auba up again !!

No point in blaming the ref you can't look to players like Cedric and Rob fucking Holding in games like this@maxrushden @guardian_sport @NickAmes82 @_JordanJBryan @bglendenning How do the podcast feel about the correlation between Rob Holding’s hairline and his increase in form, after his ill-disciplined display tonight?@maxrushden @guardian_sport @NickAmes82 @_JordanJBryan @bglendenning How much footballing ability did rob holding have to sacrifice to get his hairline back?@cantdrawarsenal Rob holding cost us this game absolute stupidity@officialpeters7 That’s more of an elbow that holding elbowing son 😂 son runs more into his shoulder 😂 
It’s calm because you’ll just lose to Burnley on Saturday and all will be well again@DarrenBent Sky seem to have missed this event that occured prior to Holding's first yellow.

- Elneny &amp; Holding are only playing because of injury. Mo has been superb, Rob has been serviceable (except for the NLD ofc)@MoSyed110 Can you really imagine rob holding Cedric and nketiah in the champions league@DannyAaronsFUT Rob Holding and Paul Tierney been great for Spurs!@A_kunz1 i was thinking rob holding should pay on the first date@Arsenal Poor poor by Rob holding tonight@AldoScrim89 Rob Holding was a red card in the making after about 5mins

It says 'player not in play' but he's been sent off https://t.co/zXLEDTynm2@CFC_Andy_ @Arsenal nah but this match is a piss take. Rob Holding playing like he doesn’t have a brain. Defending is shit. 3-0 with a red card. A loss is fine but this is obliteration and just stupidity. Too much ego in the players especially holding for getting sent off.@AFC_Maal well he definitely should of made one…like maybe when rob holding went off at the 33rd@Arsenal Holding career over, Arteta must take some responsibility it was obvious after first yellow Rob was struggling and what did the boss say at half time? It didn’t work!@Efootballer79 Haha all over the shop what do you expect with Rob Holding in your side mind@JoshuaTheGunner Yes we’re very lucky you have that donkey Rob Holding@DannyAaronsFUT Rob Holding watching from the baths https://t.co/nBB2LOn8SA@maqwelll Rob Holding https://t.co/8mfvqUeRJt@damborambo1 Zero sense Rob Holding@Tee_Classiquem1 @Arsenal No Trust the Process

Part of the reason that Cedric and Nuno just shouldn't be playing really.

Still, the second yellow is really silly.@jamesallcott What are people on about saying Son is cheating. Rob holding committed 3 yellow card challenges an elbow is an automatic red@_IKENNA_ @Arsenal Rob Holding needs to be investigated.@sibambatyoti because wtf is he doing there the ball is overhit even. yho hayi rob holding mjita ogrend but sigrend ngaye@CryptoTony__ Algo doing what's its not meant to again 👀, and Rob holding has cost us.@supersub123 Agreed and Rob Holding has had a shocker…@Arsenal Only thing arsenal is fighting is rob holding@premierleague Rob Holding was holding like an idiot tonight. What did he prepare for? A Martial Arts fight?

He let his team and the Arsenal fans down on a crucial game.

And how couldn't Arteta see the Red Card coming? It was obvious. Kids watching and screaming.. Take him off. Take him off@Arsenal Rob holding is a spurs player. He's playing against us. Farcical challenge on Son having already been booked a few minutes before. Brainfart player@hgpbays If I were a player in that changing room I’d be lobbing Cedic at Rob Holding 😂@goal Arsenal 😠😭we can complain abt the officiating tonight but Rob was silly with his challenges on son. The 1st, what's he f**king holding him for. Yu pple are4 points ahead of them,  why are yu panicking. Started so bright they should even be the ones committing the silly fouls@therealamajor Even still, he was trying to be that defender who can get tight and recover, Rob Holding has no sort of pace. Didn’t know his game. I’m talking about the ref in regards to the penalty, should be 1-0 with 10 men, not 2-0. Idiotic.@MenInBlazers Xhaka to Thierry Henry after seeing Rob Holding sent off…. https://t.co/a5krGiieiZ@MikeleKoroni @AFCWill7 @Nero16960689 @AFCMax9 Nit wrong about Rob holding he is so stupid istg he shouldn't be a defender@StatmanDave Rob Holding acted like a complete idiot tonight.

You don't give the ref an option to give pens or reds these days, you behave. 
Rob holding and Cedric Soares did not.@FBSkill @BRGoals That was careless and awful red card by Rob Holding. How can he allow himself to be downplayed by TOT’s mind gamesBeyond that, we recruited poorly in January, it was clear we needed another FB.

Rob Holding should have been in Newcastle in August. Players like him, like Cedric, like Elneny are not consistently good enough for a Top 4 pushing team.

Just the facts at this point.@SpursOfficial @SpursStadium 4 - Rob Holding made four fouls against Spurs leading up to his dismissal, with all four of them coming on Son Heung-min. His four fouls are the most he has ever made in a Premier League game, despite only playing 33 minutes. Unrestrained. https://t.co/l6ruL3EOLG@josephwills0 Talking of rob, what was rob holding doing?😂😂@now_arsenaI tbh that second yellow card was ridiculous. Maybe son should be looking where he’s going??? Rob was just running and son ran into him. What do u expect holding to do??Rob holding totally deserved that red card. Stupid decision from someone you’d expect to have the experience to make better decisions. Son was never getting to that ball. Holding let this team down today.@Arsenal 4 - Rob Holding made four fouls against Spurs leading up to his dismissal, with all four of them coming on Son Heung-min.

Grab Kane’s head and prevent him from scoring? Or maybe teach Rob Holding how to defend?@siddharthiyer01 Nonsense, Rob Holding got completely rattled by Son. Cedric elbowed Son in the back. Don’t blame the ref.@blaund19 @Thogden Rob Holding&gt;Pawson@SpursOfficial @SpursStadium Rob my Son.

All he does is holding 🤦@soccerdiva Gotta ask why you would put Rob Holding and Cedric Soares together on the same side as Son. That is beyond naive.@NozAhmed Rob? Rob Holding? Is that you?@Lacazest Rob Holding has done us. Not VAR or the ref ROB HOLDING@ghholm1 Rob Elbows Holding@now_arsenaI He didn't get it wrong, the ref has given them everything and Rob Holding lost his head. Can't blame the manager at all for this.@WillHRog rob holding song tonight mate 😅?@clivepafc I don’t know what he was thinking Clive.

The penalty was soft but 1-0 and 11 men we were in it, Holding may have cost us CL footy@michaeIolise Rob holding made 4 different fouls on Son to show he was a hard bloke in a derby. Complete idiot and deserved sending off and these lot acting like it was corrupt shocking 💀@GoonerViews No mate. That all started from rob holding BLATANTLY trying to wind up son. He had the kick in the back, then this, then next one was a boiling. Was always gonna get sent off. Turned up tryna wind up their best player instead of outplay him. Deserved to be sent off@RalfCrutzen Rob Holding ook.@keeshmatstats Rob holding just rob the game for Arsenal.@Arsenal The referee did nothing wrong. Rob Holding and Cedric should have their contracts terminated.@Arsenal We've come here with a poor mentality, Rob holding thinking he's a big man and being consistently shit for YEARS, should have started white.

All I know is that we're up 2-0 and Rob Holding is a dickbag@Arsenal There is always a fucking stupid man who ruins the hope and work of all the team. Today this man is Rob Holding. Fuck to players like him. Yesterday Dan James did the samething and sacrified his team@BenPhil14479497 Rob holding this ratio down the tunnel@NoContextEPL meanwhile rob holding is the stick@TiyaniM8 I will never forgive Rob Holding for this game.It’s 2-0 to Tottenham! Harry Kane does it again, and with Arsenal down to 10 men after Rob Holding’s sending off, it’s a long way back for the Gunners today. #TOTARS@KimEngelberg @RALee85 I mean it looks like they are holding on to the rest pretty well. 

Kyiv and Kharkiv was a retreat by the Russian army more than Ukraine taking it back. 

Trying to take back snake island seems to have been a disaster for Ukraine last week.

Just think Rob is too propaganda.The likes of Rob Holding, Granit Xhaka, Mohammed El Neny, Eddie Nketiah, Pepe have been great servants but we need to build on this young core if we want to push on.@Arsenal Ridiculous decision from Rob Holding, completely lost his head in our biggest game of the season and has cost us massively.@zee_okoli Did arteta tell rob holding do that@Arsenal rob holding thanks mate very professional great work 👍@lazqetjohnson Rob Holding https://t.co/qr94ig85CR@charles_watts And do you know why that is ?

With him it’s all about luck!!!!@SpursOfficial I found rob holding in Son's pocket@MGH Stupid should’ve gone off two fouls ago. I saw it coming: play the game, not the occasion, and, as usual, Rob Holding's lack of composure in big games has proven extremely costly. This game is now is about keeping the goal difference down. Nothing more absolutely disgraceful.@Arsenal @Arsenal sign Laturo Martinez and serious centre back please I am done with idiots like rob holding 😡@97HassanM bloodeh rob holding⚪️Tottenham Hotspurs are painting North London white.
