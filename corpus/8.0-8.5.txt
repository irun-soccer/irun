you think callum wilson is better than richarlison amd dcl 
ohhhh callum wilson🎶🎶🎶🎶 
callum wilson apparently wow 
a fully fit most of the time callum wilson doesn't play for us he's a top 6 striker we've got him as he is injury prone get 1 or 2 more of his ability to rotate with and we'll really push on 
haha my spurs boys and that last minute punt on callum wilson did all the heavy lifting it was very close though 
callum wilson is englands nr 2 centre forward always said it you've got to admit kane is special but if only we could sort out callums injury problems 
pity 2 of our strikers were injured today but then again you were without callum wilson for ages lots of local derbies to come for us now oh and a trip to sunderland too 
callum wilson is more than capable to lead our line when we get back to the europa league 
callum wilson 
describing callum wilson 😂 
that's them having a long term plan but it will happen sooner then you think with the money they will offer but i still do think they need to hold onto good experienced premier league players like callum wilson ect to move up the table and win things 
a fully fit callum wilson is 100 not guaranteed unfortunately 
i think that dennis is better than wood but not callum wilson i'd say he's good enough to play when he's injured 
callum wilson with decisive interventions in gw1 amp gw38 😉 fwiw graham potter produced a better coaching performance than klopp imho 
right lads n lasses any tattooists who will do me a free tattoo i said if we stay up i'd get a tattoo of tyrone mings frenching callum wilson i'm a man of my word 😂 
get callum wilson a statue asap 
ifs buts and maybes but had callum wilson stayed fit it's not hyperbolic suggesting we could have finished top 7 that has to be the focus next season with some shrewd investment this summer nice to actually go into a post season with optimism of transfer activity 
callum wilson plays for us because he can't stay fit if he could he'd be in a top 4 side 
if callum wilson would have been fit all season he would have been up there in the scoring charts quality player

🙌 thank you i'm actually considering captaining someone very differential 😇 like callum wilson what are you planning 
he will assist callum wilson today 🔮 
i hate it more because brighton's first goal shouldn't have counted our squad was decimated by covid and injuries for spurs and chelsea away and city had two incredibly lucky deflections off joel matip 
hands down it has to be joel matip 
jack grealish £100m player couldn't score more than joel matip who came on a free and lost fewer games in the prem season you think you are clever you aren't…see you in paris…oh… 
joel matip been phenomenal all season 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

joel matip for me 
jack grealish £100 million joel matip free and he's an absolute joy give me that piece if business any day 
diaz with 5 skills or joel matip with 85 pace 
was passes completed percentage for various players but mainly joel matip 
played your best player you just heard me say taa did not play right joel matip did not play as well james milner in mid field wow trying to prove a no point 
ferland mendy and joel matip 
joel matip with 95 pace 
joel matip scored as many league goals this season as grealish 🤣 
matip 8 10 an incredibly underrated season from joel chipping in with 3 goals and looked incredible next to virgil and trade marking his signature dribble through midfield 
1 it's tenuous as i think most players are decent penalty takers but still would players chance at a bit more physicality at corners against defenders looking to head the ball knowing that if they give away the foul it's just joel matip taking the pen haha hack a shaqish 
's second goal was actually joel matip not so the top scorer in the is actually from checkvar 
joel matip has scored the same amount of goals as you this season whatyousaying 
scores the same amount of goals as joel matip well in 
joel matip had more goals 😂😂 
joel matip has more goals this season 
same goals as joel matip🤣🤣🤣 absolute flop 
blatant cheating have you not checked city's financial records lately signed grealish for a 100m for the fun of it and he has the same amount of goals as joel matip 😂 and it's not like villarreal beat bayern and juventus or anything 👍🏼 
joel matip scored more goals than grealish this season 
is there any error on your bonus ranking for the liverpool v wolves match joel matip is getting the 3 bonus points despite failing to keep a clean sheet and getting booked 🤯 
joel matip konate gomez any of them bend him over 
and i had the guts to transfer him out for joel matip 😑😑😑💔 pain 
1 june 2019 a ball nodded down in the penalty area of the wanda metropolitano in madrid is played by joel matip out in front of 58th min sub origi he lets it roll across his body to his left before hammering the ball into the bottom right corner it's lfc's 6th european cup 
liverpool's sadio mane has scored six goals on the final day of the premier league same as vardy joel matip has scored in each of his last two premier league matches who will score today against wolves 🤔 it's the finalday action goalpoll

fantasy5 gw38 epl joel matip to beat his price point of 6 5 
really joe gomez over joel matip 
true but i also didn't expect grealish to not outscore joel matip soo 
he gives me joel matip vibes 
rik be saying joel matip deserved it in a minute 
really rate him highly and wasn't surprised at spurs buying him at all case for joel matip as well too 
you will get that cash for them as they play in the epl look ok in a fairly poor team if a player in spl n moves for decent cash he's going to be worth a fortune look at vvd kt robertson gattuso van bronckhorst however none of those you have mentioned have played in europe

was talking about a soccer player named joaquin correa 
yeah bro hard luck hopefully we can put up a fight next season too bet those joaquin correa goals improved the mood for you slightly haha 
joaquin correa scored a brace as inter milan saw off sampdoria 3 0 to finish 2nd in the seriea standings 2 points behind ac milan ssfootball

i predicted last week ac milan's game that rafael leao to score first goal he did score but i didn't hear from u guys 
bro your friend rafael leão owns us 16m tell bom to pay 
it's about the funds is the bod willing to spend during the transfer market if they really want to be competitive in the ucl they shouldn't be selling their good players like they want to do with rafael leão 
rafael leao vinicius think they've been said but just mainly because they were always they've got potential' type players and they've become so influential this season honorable mentions raspadori destiny udogie for udinese 
ac milan 2021 22 season review player of the season rafael leao young player of the season kalulu breakout star of the season daniel maldini flop of the season b diaz signing of the season maignan

rafael leao from today 
rafael leão amp pedro neto today🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 qatar going to be their world cup wait fernando santos is at the 🛞 🫣 
rafael leao slowly becoming a superstar player who can play anywhere in the front 3 really excited to see him progress hopefully with milan for a long time 
rafael leao is a baller icl he must start for portugal in the wc 
italian league is full of ballers rafael leao would be a dream signing for me 22 and had a quality season but there is no way he's going anywhere at the minute 
rafael leao it's red ❤️🖤 
scouters 👀 rafael leao from ac milan 
him zlatan ibrahimovic spent most of the season hurt but guys like rafael leao sandro tonali and mike maignan took steps forward to prove they are emerging stars in the football world and have championship type character the challenge now for this milan team will be can 
🇵🇹 rafael leao mvp and champion of italy 😋 
didn't know rafael leao is a portuguese y hasn't he been called up to the national team yet i'm wondering 
rafael leao serie a mvp plays for milan left winger great baller would be a superstar in future not needed 
thank you rafael leao 
rafael leao the wonder kid usain bolt will be envious of u now 
add 30 mil and get rafael leao 
the best and the most disappointing this season in your opinion i'll go with rafael leão and florentino vinagre 
i think madrid should seriously consider rafael leao he is a quality player and young considering the team building we want to undertake in 2023 
rafael leao seeing zlatan getting all the praise after all his heavy lifting 
rafael leao has been named serie a mvp 🥇 
u think rafael leão will not be a shit load of money just wait until they potential club finds out they have to pay additional 16m in fees to pay what happened few years ago 😂 
rafael leao isn't as good on the st position as he is one the lw lmao last season when he played as a st he didn't do anything special but on the lw he's cooking 
we are not gonna change our formation for rafael leao lol he's not r9 
you said it sha but i won't go back to that discourse so why did rafael leao win over immobile 
mom hé didn't play anything hé wasn't instrumental in their winning it was all olivier giroud and rafael leao 
absolutely agree but from limited coverage from the uk i hadn't realised how good rafael leao is until season what a player 👏 
rafael leao is also a striker very good striker do you know what we lack at the moment physicality rodrygo is but he find it difficult against rudigar coz rudigar was using a physicality over that guy leao is good either dribbling physicality finishing 
i'm buying rafael leao scamacca and dybala for free…with more than 70 to spare 
him being old doesn't mean anything rafael leao tonali in midfield giroud and theo won this title even maignan in goal zlatan maybe brought in that winning mentality and maturity but he shouldn't be praises more than the above players man 
wow rafael leao i didn't expect that even though he has been superb for the past few weeks 
someone called it that zlatan will be the face of this championship whereas rafael leao was pivotal to milan's success🚮 
rafael leao carry the two a dem 😅 
wow no praise for the real contributors rafael leao theo hernandez and giroud but zlatan came and conquered 
another scudetto for zlatan and milan just to remind you guys that rafael leao kessie tonali theo maignan tomori kalulu etc were still in their teenage diapers the last time zlatan lifted the title with ac milan he's evergreen🔥 acmilan scudetto ibrahimovic seriaa

rafael leao is a brazilian footballer who plays for ac milan 
if there is one transfer i would like is to go for rafael leao but oh yeah we don't have cl football i think ceballos is available on loan

there is always rafael leao 
rafael leao 3 assist very nice 
don't forget all assist by rafael leao congrats gar 
talking about inspiration rafael leão provided all 3 assists helping teammates to claim the scudetto 👉sassuolo 0 3 ac milan up to 43 minutes goals by olivier giroud 2 and franck kessié 
please sign rafael leao from ac milan 
11 years drought but it was worth it rafael leão is him 
sign rafael leao no matter the cost 
it definitely is now franck kessie teed up again but rafael leão on the right this time the scudetto is red and black sassuolomilan 0 3 
rafael leao with an assists hatrick 
rafael leao is a baller broo 
rafael leão with hat trick of assists this kid is so good 
check out rafael leao guys 
with mbappe staying at psg who are you getting instead nkunku or nunez or rafael leao or schick or kane 
and yes rafael leao for ballon d'or 
another one two rafael leão assists to put milan 2 0 up 
his pace is not as good as rafael leão's though 
rafael leão is a baller but the kid tends to be so lazy at times 😔 
1 0 all thanks to rafael leao's defensive effort leading to a goal from olivier giroud 
rafael leao should've passed the ball 
rafael leão better option imo not a lethal goalscorer but is very good at pace physicality and build up play 
meanwhile milan's 4 2 3 1 contains olivier giroud as the line leader again with a left to right trio of rafael leão rade krunić and alexis saelemaekers behind him once more sandro tonali and franck kessié again work as a midfield duo behind that front quartet 0⃣ 0⃣ seriea 
thoughts on rafael leao 
rafael leao left winger nkunku left winger sadio mane left winger son left winger … i would cross all these names off the list 
i think rafael leao of ac milan will be a perfect fit for madrid 
no we want rafael leao 
now get rafael leao man is a baller younger than mbappe and can used to play as striker 
targets rn should be tchouameni lewandowski darwin nunez rafael leao fran garcia top rw cheap rb backup 
rafael leao now can used to play as 9 younger than mbappe can end up being a better deal 
any news on rafael leao to madrid 
i personally i'm in love wit this rafael leao 
tchoumeni rafael leao richalson and salah could bring somthing at los blanco 
what is your opinion about rafael leao form milan 
please give us rafael leao this guy would be a phenomenal transfer 
22 nkunku 23 mendy e 24 jota 25 rodri 26 aubameyang 27 rafael leao 28 thiago silva 29 reece james 30 rodrygo this is all according to the shit criteria the ballondor uses 
get rafael leao and we will be even better given that he can used to play as a striker too younger than mbappe and an absolute beast watch him with milan he is class 
rafael leao just watch him he just needs a big stage to shine in he has been an absolute beast for milan and can play as striker still 22 y o younger than mbappe 
they are too old i'd definitely go for rafael leao 22y o younger than mbappe an absolute beast in milan can play as striker and has great finishing man can have a better career than mbappe in madrid no excuses papa seal this deal 
talk on ac milan also theo hernandez what a player bettter than your pl stars and rafael leao mike maignan what a talents 
lets go for rafael leão fast strong tall explosive and better than nkunku 
i've watched so many games of rafael leao anf he definitely has not the talent 
rafael leao younger than mbappe and didn't get his chance to shine on the big stage man is an absloute beast with milan and can play as striker just watch him… can easily surpass mbappe no more excuses papa 
tchoumeni a right footed winger like mahrez and maybe a player like rafael leão but not darwin nunez 
tchouameni skriniar bremer rafael leao nkunko pedro porro youssoufa moukoko 2nd striker 17 y o scoring for fun can replace benzema in the coming years and surpass mbappe endrick send him on la liga loans to develop no more excuses papa 
get rafael leao and we are more than happy younger can play as a striker and watch the fucking player he might easily have a better career than kylian in madrid 
rafael leao younger than mbappe and can play as a striker too watch his highlights… no more excuses papa seal this deal 
we should go all in for rafael leao he is a beast and can play as a striker 
rafael leao is a beast and can play in the striker position 
i would prefer rafael leao 
harry kane darwin nunez lewandowski rafael leao what a lod of shite this manu guy 
rafael leao is a good choice but he is a left winger 
focusing on blocking the pass from the right flank thereby freeing up space for rafael leão to exploit on the left calabria is also good especially defensively as he´ll come in as a 3rd cb with the rw coming back helping to defend in terms of attacking transitions he´ll then 
the good players had to be sold to even the books the club had mediocre player for while now with the introduction of maldini and pioli that changed in came ismael bennacer rafael leao theo hernandez leo duarte rade krunic alexis saelemaekers zlatan giroud and maignan 
luis sinisterra cody gakpo jesper karlsson martin terrier domenico berardi rafael leao pedro goncalves should be the only optipons but the last 2 likely to be to expensive 
rafael leao and theo hernandez both of acmilan 
the guy dey daft osimhen racked his stats with injuries and playing in the serie a this one dey compare am to nunez for portuguese league ment rafael leao leemao 
please jt tell chelsea and tt to sign aurelien tchouameni christopher nkuku darwin nunes ivan perisic jules kounde or maxence lacroix kalidou koulibaly by all means 
napoli manager spalletti on barça rumours for koulibaly i consider kalidou koulibaly as untouchable player for us he's not for sale in my plan 🔵 transfers i also want both david ospina and dries mertens to continue here napoli next season spalletti added
