on reducing amp ending pavement parking that's longer term 
i'm a realist we cannot make pavement parking illegal over night it has to be phased in 
have you tried living without a car 
have you looked at your local bus timetables where's your nearest bus stop how often do your nearest buses run to amp from food shops would i be wrong to assume you have a driveway 
do you have a motor vehicle where do you park it 
are you suggesting local councils should ban all parking on public roads 
parking tickets from private car parks are not fixed penalty notices fpn which are only issued by the police local council or dvla 
and how does that work when you go food shopping or have babies or toddlers and buggies and other stuff that you need to transport 
how do you think these people have had to react because their access and enjoyment of public space is blocked restricted 
you have to consider the clubs that would be interested in signing them amp what wages they expect for a lot of clubs 100k pw is a big ask henderson for example is on triple nick pope’s wages 
how do you think these people would react if they are no longer able to legally park their cars how would councils amp police handle this

nah im in tears 😭😭 he's been the worst player this season 💀 he has lost his goddamn mind if anything our mbappe is reece james 
reece james is gonna win as lampard won he has everything 
as the better defender and versatility it's james for me but the better passer attacker it's trent 
reece james has been playing with donkey attackers for too long put reece behind salah mane jota gets 20 assists a season easily everyone forgets the quality of the pass once it’s missed taa’s assist nos only higher cos he’s got quality attackers converting them factos 
just give me a team of reece james get tammy back im sorry these are spicy tweets but i’m tired of some of our players 
how are you doing rank wise mark still hoping for those reece james points 😂 
or thiago silva 
people seriously need to stop grouping the two together ffs reece james is genuinely world class and is definitely the top 3 rb’s in the whole of europe 21 doesn’t even hack top 7 in europe 
yes he was drifting in playing as an inverted wingback in d 1st half because ziyech was going out wild 
reece james 2021 2022 9 assists 6 goals mad stats considering rj was out with injury for around 3 months he’s just getting started🤫⚡️… https t co muugkffqrg 
he was playing like reece james he got an assist and almost scored not saying vale is not good though just haven't seen enough from him 
no right back is better than arnold 
amartey was top draw tonight as he has been all season evans and fofana reliably strong as well mendy did the dirty work well and continues to impress the only person who struggled tonight was luke thomas worth remembering his age but he found it hard against reece james 
1 point fair enough 3rd place secured and a much needed holiday awaits 
tuchel to be playing reece james as a left 10 for 20mins just shows how poor these guys are 
i've always hated summer because there's no football season but i've been counting down the days for this season to end for about 2 months now players manager home crowd all total rubbish 
chelsea fans in the media arw tiresome 
in answer to your q more of the same reece james cm cameo all very boring aside from that 
serious baller 👏 
slight improvement from 1st half if we're gonna play a draw why not play the kids if we complain players being leggy after a long season surely it's the best safest time to play kids reece beast james 💙😍 pulisic giving us nightmares of cup finishing 😭 
james is crazy mehn 
also also reece james is waaaay better than trent 
also azpi can leave all he's doing is holding back reece james 
although i love reece james i forget sometimes😭😭

we know how high the ceiling can be for reece james when it comes to fpl points only 49 chance of a cs but with watford missing most of their attacking threats i was expecting it to be higher 2nd highest xp for a defender in gw38 with 6 3 points just behind alonso 
next up chelsea boys mason mount 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 reece james 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 romelu lukaku 🇧🇪 mount usually starts in that front 3 even more so if havertz amp werner are still out we saw watford ship goals at home to leicester with vardy maddison barnes hauling very much fancy mount vs wat
