you think callum wilson is better than richarlison amd dcl 
ohhhh callum wilson🎶🎶🎶🎶 
callum wilson apparently wow 
a fully fit most of the time callum wilson doesn't play for us he's a top 6 striker we've got him as he is injury prone get 1 or 2 more of his ability to rotate with and we'll really push on 
haha my spurs boys and that last minute punt on callum wilson did all the heavy lifting it was very close though 
callum wilson is englands nr 2 centre forward always said it you've got to admit kane is special but if only we could sort out callums injury problems 
pity 2 of our strikers were injured today but then again you were without callum wilson for ages lots of local derbies to come for us now oh and a trip to sunderland too 
callum wilson is more than capable to lead our line when we get back to the europa league

describing callum wilson 😂 
that's them having a long term plan but it will happen sooner then you think with the money they will offer but i still do think they need to hold onto good experienced premier league players like callum wilson ect to move up the table and win things 
a fully fit callum wilson is 100 not guaranteed unfortunately 
i think that dennis is better than wood but not callum wilson i'd say he's good enough to play when he's injured

ifs buts and maybes but had callum wilson stayed fit it's not hyperbolic suggesting we could have finished top 7 that has to be the focus next season with some shrewd investment this summer nice to actually go into a post season with optimism of transfer activity 
callum wilson plays for us because he can't stay fit if he could he'd be in a top 4 side

he will assist callum wilson today 🔮 
i hate it more because brighton's first goal shouldn't have counted our squad was decimated by covid and injuries for spurs and chelsea away and city had two incredibly lucky deflections off joel matip 
hands down it has to be joel matip 
jack grealish £100m player couldn't score more than joel matip who came on a free and lost fewer games in the prem season you think you are clever you aren't…see you in paris…oh… 
joel matip been phenomenal all season 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

jack grealish £100 million joel matip free and he's an absolute joy give me that piece if business any day 
diaz with 5 skills or joel matip with 85 pace 
was passes completed percentage for various players but mainly joel matip 
played your best player you just heard me say taa did not play right joel matip did not play as well james milner in mid field wow trying to prove a no point 
ferland mendy and joel matip 
joel matip with 95 pace 
joel matip scored as many league goals this season as grealish 🤣 
matip 8 10 an incredibly underrated season from joel chipping in with 3 goals and looked incredible next to virgil and trade marking his signature dribble through midfield 
1 it's tenuous as i think most players are decent penalty takers but still would players chance at a bit more physicality at corners against defenders looking to head the ball knowing that if they give away the foul it's just joel matip taking the pen haha hack a shaqish 
's second goal was actually joel matip not so the top scorer in the is actually from checkvar 
joel matip has scored the same amount of goals as you this season whatyousaying 
scores the same amount of goals as joel matip well in 
joel matip had more goals 😂😂 
joel matip has more goals this season 
same goals as joel matip🤣🤣🤣 absolute flop 
blatant cheating have you not checked city's financial records lately signed grealish for a 100m for the fun of it and he has the same amount of goals as joel matip 😂 and it's not like villarreal beat bayern and juventus or anything 👍🏼 
joel matip scored more goals than grealish this season 
is there any error on your bonus ranking for the liverpool v wolves match joel matip is getting the 3 bonus points despite failing to keep a clean sheet and getting booked 🤯 
joel matip konate gomez any of them bend him over 
and i had the guts to transfer him out for joel matip 😑😑😑💔 pain 
1 june 2019 a ball nodded down in the penalty area of the wanda metropolitano in madrid is played by joel matip out in front of 58th min sub origi he lets it roll across his body to his left before hammering the ball into the bottom right corner it's lfc's 6th european cup 
liverpool's sadio mane has scored six goals on the final day of the premier league same as vardy joel matip has scored in each of his last two premier league matches who will score today against wolves 🤔 it's the finalday action goalpoll 
1 virgil van dijk 2 joel matip 3 joe gomez 4 fabinho 1st pick replacement 5 henderson 1st pick replacement 6 ozan kabak panic buy replacement 7 ben davies another panic buy replacement 8 billy koumetio under 21s up stepped 9 nat phillips 10 rhys williams 
fantasy5 gw38 epl joel matip to beat his price point of 6 5 
really joe gomez over joel matip 
true but i also didn't expect grealish to not outscore joel matip soo 
he gives me joel matip vibes 
rik be saying joel matip deserved it in a minute 
really rate him highly and wasn't surprised at spurs buying him at all case for joel matip as well too 
you will get that cash for them as they play in the epl look ok in a fairly poor team if a player in spl n moves for decent cash he's going to be worth a fortune look at vvd kt robertson gattuso van bronckhorst however none of those you have mentioned have played in europe 
now i know andrew robertson the soccer player and the photographer 🤣🤣
